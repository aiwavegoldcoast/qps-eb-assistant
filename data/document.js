A position may be designated a Brevet Rank position for no longer\n than the normal tenure period applicable to the position from the date of duty of the\n successful applicant for the position.\n\n (d) Merit based selection and appointment will be used to fill designated Brevet Rank\n positions.\n\n (e) In circumstances where no suitable applicants are determined to a designated Brevet Rank\n position, the position may be filled by lateral transfer in which case the position ceases to\n be designated a Brevet Rank Position.\n\n (f) A police officer may be appointed to a Brevet Rank position and be paid salary applicable\n to that Brevet Rank only while they are appointed to that designated Brevet Rank position.\n\n (g) A Sergeant position designated as Brevet Sergeant or Senior Sergeant position designated\n as Brevet Senior Sergeant will be filled using an open merit selection process restricted\n to applicants who are either Management Development Program (MDP) or Leadership\n Capability Program (LCP) qualified Senior Constables/Sergeants, or Senior\n Constables/Sergeants enrolled in LCP applicable to the Brevet Rank. Appointment of the\n successful applicant in these circumstances will be as follows:\n\n i. If the successful applicant is MDP or LCP qualified for appointment to Sergeant or\n Senior Sergeant as the case may be, the police officer will be appointed as a\n substantive Sergeant or Senior Sergeant and the designated \u201cBrevet\u201d status of the\n position will be revoked; or\n\n ii. If the successful applicant is enrolled in MDP or LCP relevant to the Brevet Rank but\n not yet qualified for appointment to that rank, the officer will be appointed as a Brevet\n Sergeant or Senior Sergeant.\n\n 13\n\n iii. If the successful applicant completes MDP or LCP and is qualified for appointment\n to the rank prior to completion of their tenure in the Brevet Rank position, the officer\n will be appointed as a substantive Sergeant or Senior Sergeant at their current pay\n point and the designated Brevet status of the position will be revoked. In this situation,\n tenure will not recommence.\n\n iv. If the successful applicant has not completed MDP or LCP at the completion of their\n tenure, the officer will not be eligible to be appointed as a substantive Sergeant or\n Senior Sergeant.\n\n (h) At least 3 months before the completion of tenure period of a Brevet Rank appointment,\n the position must be re-advertised for filling by merit appointment at the substantive rank.\n\n (i) Second and subsequent designated Brevet Rank appointments may be made by the\n Service provided that should such appointments be made involving the same officer,\n normal pay point progression arrangements at the higher rank will apply while the officer\n is so appointed.\n\n12.7 Prosecutors\n\n (a) Definitions\n\n For the purposes of this clause, the following definitions apply:\n\n i. \"Experience as a prosecutor\" - means experience performing the duties of a\n prosecutor following the successful completion of the Police Prosecutions\n Training Course or having received recognised prior competency by the\n Prosecutions Training Office.

The provisions of this Agreement will continue to apply to the ranks of\n Constable and Senior Constable for:\n\n I. filling vacancies in Prosecutions Sections; and\n\n II. progression within and between those ranks.\n\n ii. Vacancies in Prosecution Sections designated at the rank of Sergeant will\n continue to be filled by merit pursuant to section 5.2(2) of the PSAA as amended\n from time to time.\n\n iii. Service tenure requirements upon appointment or transfer to vacancies in\n Prosecution Sections will continue to apply. Police Officers may apply for\n positions that are to be filled by merit pursuant to section 5.2 (2) of the PSAA\n as amended from time to time.\n\n (c) Progression to the Rank of Sergeant\n\n i. A Constable or a Senior Constable who successfully completes the Police\n Prosecutions Training Course and is appointed to a position within a\n Prosecutions Section will progress (subject to satisfactory DAPs) to the rank of\n\n 14\n\n Sergeant after five (5) years continuous experience as a prosecutor with the\n Service.\n\n ii. A Constable will not progress to the rank of Sergeant unless all relevant DAP\n and training requirements have been completed.\n\n iii. The following applies to a police officer progressing to the rank of Sergeant:\n\n I. normal pay point progression as provided in clause 12.4 of this Agreement\n will apply;\n\n II. the police officer will not be subject to any additional tenure requirements\n other than those applying pursuant to clause 12.7(b)(iii); and\n\n III. if the police officer wishes to leave the Prosecutions Section, then the\n employee may apply for:\n\n \u2022 positions that are to be filled by merit pursuant to section 5.2(2) of the\n PSAA as amended from time to time; or\n\n \u2022 a lateral transfer pursuant to Part Six of this Agreement provided the\n police officer has successfully completed appropriate operational re-\n orientation.\n\n12.8 Commissioned Officers\n\n (a) Police Officers attaining each commissioned officer rank commence on the relevant first\n pay point.\n\n (b) Progression within each rank above the first pay point requires a minimum of 12 months\n service on each pay point, plus satisfactory DAP.\n\n (c) An Inspector who holds a Graduate Certificate qualification or higher and has a minimum\n of 12 months service on top Inspector pay point will be deemed a Chief Inspector with\n appropriate insignia and will progress to Chief Inspector pay point.\n\n12.9 Progression on Demotion\n\n This provision applies where a police officer has voluntarily taken a demotion and is\n subsequently promoted to a higher rank. In these circumstances the officer may apply to the\n Commissioner (or delegate) to be re-appointed to the pay point held at the higher rank\n immediately prior to the voluntary demotion. This provision only applies where such a\n promotion has occurred within 12 calendar months of the voluntary demotion being gazetted.\n Once re-appointed to the higher rank, the officer must serve 12 months on the relevant pay point\n before they can progress to the next pay point (subject to clause 12 requirements).\n\n12.10 Pay point progression on Re-Appointment\n\n Where an appointee, who has previously resigned as a sworn officer from the Service and is re-\n appointed to a position at any rank at a relevant pay point in recognition of their previous service,\n will be required to complete a further 12 months service prior to progression to the next pay\n point. Provided that the relevant progressional criteria prescribed in clause 12 herein for each\n relevant rank is met.\n\n 15\n\n 12.11 Recognition of Higher Duties on Promotion\n\n A police officer promoted to a higher rank will commence on the rank at one pay point higher\n than they ordinarily would (including where the provision in subclause 12.4(a) applies) where\n the officer has performed higher duties at the new (or higher) rank for an aggregate period of 12\n months or more in the immediately preceding 24 months, from effective date of promotion as\n listed in the QPS Gazette.\n\n13 Vacancies to be Advertised\n\n 13.1 Subject to subclause 12.2(e) of this Agreement, where a position at or above the rank of Sergeant\n becomes vacant or is newly created, the Commissioner must, before making a permanent\n appointment, advertise the vacancy in the Queensland Police Gazette as soon as practicable.\n\n 13.2 The requirement to advertise under subclause 13.1 does not apply to vacancies or new positions\n filled in accordance with the lateral transfer terms in Part 6.\n\n14 Salary Packaging\n\n 14.1 Salary packaging is available for employees (excluding short-term casual employees) covered\n by this Agreement in accordance with Queensland Government policy found in the Circular\n issued from time to time by the Office of Industrial Relations and the following principles:\n\n (a) As part of the salary package arrangements, the cost for administering the package,\n including fringe benefits tax, is met by the employee;\n\n (b) There will be no additional increase in superannuation costs or to fringe benefits payments\n made by the Service;\n\n (c) Increases or variations in taxation are to be passed to employees as part of their salary\n package;\n\n (d) Where mandated by relevant government policies, employees must obtain independent\n financial advice prior to taking up a salary package. Where no mandatory requirement\n exists, it is strongly recommended all employees seek independent financial advice when\n entering into a salary packaging arrangement for the first time, or adding new item(s) to\n an already agreed packaging arrangement;\n\n (e) The Service will pass on to the employee any Input Tax Credits (ITCs) it receives as part\n of salary packaging;\n\n (f) There will be no significant additional administrative workload or other ongoing costs to\n the Service;\n\n (g) Any additional administrative and fringe benefits tax costs are to be met by the employee;\n\n (h) Any increases or variations to taxation, excluding payroll tax that result in additional costs\n are to be passed on to the employee as part of the salary package.\n\n 14.2 The employee\u2019s salary for superannuation purposes and severance and termination payments\n will be the gross salary which the employee would receive if not taking part in flexible\n remuneration packaging.\n\n 14.3 Subject to federal legislation, employees may elect to adjust their current salary sacrifice\n arrangements to sacrifice up to 100% of salary to superannuation.\n\n 16\n\nPART THREE - HOURS OF WORK, ROSTERING, OVERTIME \u2013 POLICE OFFICERS\n\n15 Ability to Disconnect \u2013 Police Officers\n\n 15.1 The Service acknowledges the importance of respecting police officer\u2019s periods of leave and\n rest days.\n\n 15.2 Police officers should not be contacted outside of the officer\u2019s rostered hours of work, except:\n\n (a) For emergency situations;\n\n (b) For genuine welfare matters;\n\n (c) To provide information that does not require the officer to perform duty (e.g.\n information regarding a shift change or to canvas the officer\u2019s ability to work overtime\n or a Special duty);\n\n (d) Where a non-commissioned officer is on-call, or subject to clause 16.2 for\n Commissioned Officers.\n\n 15.3 Subject to the above, police officers are not required to read or respond to emails or phone\n calls outside their ordinary rostered hours, unless the officer is on-call.\n\nCOMMISSIONED OFFICERS\n\n16 Hours of Work\n\n 16.1 Hours of work for the purpose of this clause are the hours a commissioned officer is effectively\n available to perform the requirements of their role. It is acknowledged that a commissioned\n officer\u2019s salary (unless otherwise prescribed in this Agreement) is inclusive of ordinary hours,\n extended hours and on-call hours where justifiable. Hours of work are managed, monitored and\n arranged in accordance with clauses 15, 16.2, 16.3 and 16.4.\n\n 16.2 The parties recognise periods of leave will be respected (e.g. annual leave, long service leave,\n sick leave etc).\n\n In recognition of clause 16.1 above, the parties agree commissioned officers may be contacted\n outside of ordinary hours of work where required, however managers and supervisors will limit\n contact, as far as practicable.\n\n Managers and supervisors may still provide communication outside of ordinary hours which\n does not require the officer to consider or respond until they next perform work.\n\n 16.3 Subject to subclause 16.4 below, the Commissioner may roster commissioned officers as\n required for the purposes of a declared special event or major emergency, e.g. Olympic Games,\n other major prolonged sporting events, major weather events, etc. A declaration is only made\n by the Commissioner or appointed delegate, or in the case of critical incidents, the\n Commissioner of Queensland Fire Department or the applicable Minister.\n\n 16.4 Where justifiable, the Commissioner may require commissioned officers to perform extended\n hours of duty. No additional compensation is payable for extended hours of duty. Award\n provisions prescribed at clause 15.2(a), (d) and (f) of the Award do not apply to commissioned\n officers, however a commissioned officer\u2019s supervisor/manager may approve reasonable time\n off without debit to a leave account where they consider the commissioned officer has regularly\n worked in excess of their usual hours.\n\n 17\n\n Note: Managed time is NOT to be interpreted as TOIL and is not to be requested or\n approved on an hour for hour basis.\n\n17 Ten Hour Breaks\n\n 17.1 Ordinary rostered shifts\n\n Unless justifiable or where subclause 17.2 below is applied, there must be a 10-hour break\n between ordinary rostered shifts.\n\n A justifiable reason includes but not limited to any of the following:\n\n \u2022 Where the duty to be undertaken cannot be planned for and is outside of the control of the\n Service;\n\n \u2022 Where the work of the station, section or establishment cannot proceed without the police\n officer in question being on duty and there is no other alternative;\n\n \u2022 Where it is imperative that the work being undertaken by the police officer in question is\n not delayed.\n\n 17.2 Where a police officer lives in close proximity to a designated remote locality station, it is\n possible for the 10-hour break requirement to be waived by mutual consent between the officer\n and an appropriate Supervisor/Manager, provided that the break observed in lieu thereof is not\n less than 8 hours.\n\n 17.3 No additional compensation is payable and fatigue leave will not be available where minimum\n break provisions cannot be met.\n\n18 Programmed Days Off\n\n 18.1 A commissioned officer is entitled to one Programmed Day Off (PDO) within each 28-day roster\n period.\n\n 18.2 A manager should not refuse to allow a commissioned officer access to a PDO unless\n operational requirements dictate otherwise. In such cases the PDO not taken may be accrued,\n provided that the maximum amount of PDOs to be accrued at any point in time is limited to 7.\n commissioned officers who are rostered to work a 24-hour rotational roster will be able to accrue\n up to 12 PDOs.\n\n 18.3 Ideally, every effort must be made to take such accrued PDOs as soon as possible after accrual.\n\n 18.4 It is recognised that accrued PDOs may be utilised at a convenient time for professional\n development absences.\n\n 18.5 An accrued PDO will be taken within 12 calendar months of the date on which each PDO was\n accrued. Any accrued PDO not taken within 12 calendar months of date of accrual will be\n forfeited.\n\n 18.6 A PDO may be taken in conjunction with any leave or rest days.\n\n 18.7 There will be no cash equivalent paid in lieu of PDOs.\n\n 18.8 The rostering of PDOs on a public holiday is not advocated.\n\n 18\n\n19 Shift Work\n\n 19.1 No additional compensation is payable for work undertaken by commissioned officers in excess\n of the 38-hour week, on weekends, public holidays, or shift work, unless subclause 19.2 applies.\n\n 19.2 A commissioned officer who is rostered to work ordinary hours between 6:00pm and 6:00am\n will be paid in addition to their ordinary salary a shift penalty of 15% if a continuous period of\n four (4) hours or more is worked between 6:00pm and 6:00am on any day.\n\n 19.3 Commissioned officers performing shift work will not be rostered to work more than 56\n weekend shifts in a year. Should they be required to work, in emergent circumstances only, there\n is no additional compensation payable.\n\n 19.4 Commissioned officers performing shift work should not be rostered to work additional shifts\n on a regular basis. Any additional shifts required to be worked, or additional time required to be\n worked, should be of an emergent or unpredictable nature and there is no additional\n compensation payable.\n\n 19.5 Commissioned officers who are rostered on a 24-hour rotational roster will be compensated in\n accordance with clause 49.\n\n20 On Call\n\n 20.1 As part of their role, a commissioned officer may be required to be on-call. There is no additional\n payment made when a commissioned officer is required to be on-call. Recall to duty and\n overtime provisions do not apply to commissioned officers.\n\n 20.2 Commissioned Officers who are required to be on-call must have access to at least one (1) full\n week (including the weekend) in every 28-day roster period where they are not required to be\n on-call unless justifiable. Where a commissioned officer is required to work extended hours\n during this period, no additional compensation is payable.\n\n 20.3 Commissioned officers cannot be placed on-call during any period of leave.\n\n 20.4 Where a Commissioned Officer is required to be on call for an extended period, consideration\n is to be given to the provisions of Clause 16.4.\n\n21 Venue Commander\n\n 21.1 As part of the Ability to Disconnect Arrangements prescribed at clause 15, Venue Commander\n duties are, whenever possible, to be scheduled within ordinary hours. When required to perform\n venue commander duties outside of ordinary hours a commissioned officer will be entitled to a\n day off in lieu.\n\n 21.2 Similar to PDOs, any day off in lieu will be taken within the relevant 28-day roster period,\n unless operational requirements dictate otherwise. In such cases the day off in lieu may be\n accrued in accordance with subclause 18.2 to 18.7 of this Agreement and will be combined with\n PDOs towards the maximum accrued days specified at subclause 18.2.\n\nNON-COMMISSIONED OFFICERS\n\n22 Hours of Work\n\n 22.1 Subject to subclauses 22.2, 22.3 and 22.5 below, the ordinary hours of work as prescribed in the\n Award will be worked continuously and not exceed twelve (12) hours on any day.\n\n 19\n\n 22.2 The arrangement of working hours where the ordinary working hours are to exceed eight (8) on\n any day will be at the determination of the Commissioner.\n\n 22.3 Provided that in any arrangement of working hours where the ordinary working hours are to\n exceed ten (10) hours on any day or afternoon shift, and eight (8) hours on any night shift, the\n arrangement of hours will be subject to the agreement between the Commissioner (or delegate)\n and the police officer 's representative or industrial organisation.\n\n 22.4 An entire ordinary shift is deemed to be worked on the day the shift commences. Overtime is\n payable based on when the overtime is actually performed.\n\n 22.5 Branch Managers and Assistant Branch Managers at QPCYWAs (excluding head office) may\n work a \u201csplit shift\u201d arrangement where there is agreement in writing between the officer and the\n Service. A \u201csplit shift\u201d is where an ordinary rostered shift is split into two separate periods of\n ordinary rostered hours. The officer will keep a record of when split shifts are worked.\n\n23 Ten Hour Breaks\n\n 23.1 Ordinary rostered shifts\n\n Unless justifiable or subclauses 23.2 or 23.5 below are applied, there must be a 10-hour break\n between ordinary rostered shifts.\n\n A justifiable reason includes any of the following:\n\n (a) Where the duty to be undertaken cannot be planned for and is outside of the control of\n the Service (e.g. late notification of an attendance at Court);\n\n (b) Where the work of the station, section or establishment cannot proceed without the police\n officer in question being on duty (e.g. a crew cannot operate without that police officer\n being available for duty) and there is no other alternative;\n\n (c) Where it is imperative that the work being undertaken by the police officer in question is\n not delayed (e.g. urgent investigative work).\n\n 23.2 Where a police officer lives in close proximity to a designated remote locality station, it is\n possible for the 10-hour break requirement to be waived by mutual consent between the police\n officer and an appropriate commissioned officer, provided that the break observed in lieu thereof\n is not less than 8 hours. In this case, all provisions contained in clause 23 are to be read by\n substituting the expression \"10 hours\" with the expression \"8 hours\".\n\n 23.3 Overtime worked directly following a shift\n\n (a) Unless justifiable (as defined) there must be a 10-hour break:\n\n i. after the completion of overtime that is worked directly following the\n conclusion of a rostered shift; and\n\n ii. before the commencement of the next rostered shift.\n\n (b) If an officer works overtime past the completion of a rostered shift which would result in\n the police officer not having access to a 10-hour break prior to the commencement of the\n next rostered shift, the following procedure is to be followed:\n\n 20\n\n i. A decision must be made, before completion of such overtime, as to whether a\n 10-hour break can be given. If there is no justification which would warrant a\n shorter break, the police officer will be granted a 10-hour break.\n\n ii. At the time of granting the 10-hour break a second decision has to be made, i.e.\n is there justification to warrant a change of shift. If there is no justification the\n police officer commences duty after the 10-hour break and completes the\n remainder of that shift. If there is sufficient and warranted reason to alter the\n shift the police officer, after a 10-hour break, would commence an 8-hour shift.\n\n iii. If there is sufficient and warranted justification to warrant not granting the 10-\n hour break, then the police officer would resume duty at the commencement of\n the next rostered shift.\n\n23.4 Recall to duty\n\n There is no requirement for a 10-hour break:\n\n (a) between the end of a shift and the commencement of a recall to duty; and\n\n (b) after the end of a recall to duty and the commencement of the next rostered shift\n\n (c) however, this does not preclude the requirement to consider health and safety and fatigue\n management provisions as per clause 80 of this Agreement.\n\n23.5 Shift Swaps\n\n Where employees seek to swap shifts by mutual agreement, the 10-hour break must be\n maintained for each officer.\n\n23.6 Specials\n\n (a) Non-wide-load escort specials which attract overtime payments will be treated as per\n subclause 23.3 above, if such special is worked directly following a rostered shift or prior\n to the commencement of a rostered shift.\n\n Where there is a break between the end of a rostered shift and the special, or where there\n is a break between the end of a special and the start of a rostered shift, there is no\n requirement for a 10-hour break. However, both the police officer and supervisor must\n consider the health and safety and fatigue management provisions as per clause 80 of this\n Agreement in determining that the rest period between the special and the rostered shift is\n adequate.\n\n (b) In relation to wide-load escort specials, where the distance travelled from the officer's home\n station exceeds 350 kilometres there must be a period of not less than 12 hours, unless\n justifiable (as defined), between the time the police officer returns to their home station off\n escort duty and the time of commencing their next rostered shift.\n\n In addition, there is to be a break observed by the police officer before such police officer\n leaves their home station or home for the purpose of escorting a wide load. In determining\n what is a suitable break, an Officer in Charge is to take into consideration the health and\n safety fatigue management provisions prescribed at clause 80 of this Agreement. Also, to\n be considered is the complete distance to be travelled by the police officer (i.e. the return\n distance from their home station or home) and also the estimated time taken to complete\n the entire exercise from a Health and Safety perspective, and the possible fatigue\n management impact on adjacent rostered shifts.\n\n 21\n\n24 Programmed Days Off\n\n 24.1 (a) Where the arrangement of ordinary hours of work provides for a Programmed Day Off\n (PDO), and subject to subclause 24.3 below, all police officers will work to a roster which\n will provide for PDOs on a 28-day basis i.e. in usual circumstances non-commissioned\n officers will work a 19-day month.\n\n (b) A PDO may be taken on its own, or in conjunction with leave or rest days.\n\n (c) Where it appears that a non-commissioned officer will not be able to access a PDO due to\n operational reasons then every effort should be made to change the PDO to a mutually\n agreeable date elsewhere within the same roster. The officer must be advised of the\n alteration as soon as practicable.\n\n (d) Provided that where this is unable to be complied with and the non-commissioned officer\n is directed to work on a PDO with no corresponding roster alteration, overtime is payable\n for such work.\n\n 24.2 In relation to accrual of PDOs the following applies:\n\n (a) Non-commissioned officers at one and two officer stations and QPCYWAs can accrue\n PDOs up to a maximum of 5 in accordance with clauses 82 and 83 of this Agreement.\n\n (b) Non-commissioned officers at the following stations will be able to accrue up to 12 PDOs\n in accordance with arrangements outlined below:\n\n Aurukun Lockhart River\n Bamaga Longreach\n Barcaldine Mornington Island\n Blackall Mt Isa\n Burketown Muttaburra\n Charleville Normanton\n Cherbourg Palm Island\n Cloncurry Pormpuraaw\n Coen Quilpie\n Cooktown Thursday Island\n Cunnamulla Weipa\n Doomadgee Winton\n Hope Vale Woorabinda\n Hughenden Yarrabah\n Kowanyama\n\n (c) Non-commissioned officers at the ranks of Sergeant and Senior Sergeant who receive the\n OIC Allowance and occupy an OIC role are able to accrue up to 7 PDOs and 12 PDOs\n respectively in accordance with the following:\n\n i. The accrued PDOs will be taken within 12 calendar months of the date on which\n each PDO was accrued.\n\n ii. PDOs will be exhausted by taking them on their own or in conjunction with\n leave.\n\n iii. If the Service defers the taking of accumulated PDOs beyond 12 calendar\n months for organisational reasons, then deferred PDOs are to be taken by the\n non-commissioned officer at a mutually agreed date within 24 months from the\n date of accrual of each deferred PDO.\n\n 22\n\n iv. If accumulated PDOs have not been deferred by the Service and the officer fails\n to access them within 12 calendar months after accrual, then those PDOs are\n lost.\n\n (d) Where agreement is reached between the parties, the list of stations contained at subclause\n 24.2(b) above may be amended to include other remote stations.\n\n (e) Non-commissioned officers who are required to be absent on duty from their usual station\n for protracted investigations or operations of a similar nature, other than performing\n relieving duties, and for a continuous period in excess of 28 days, will be able to accumulate\n any PDO accrued during this period of absence:\n\n Provided that all PDOs accumulated under this provision are accessed by the officer as\n soon as practicable, and within the next accounting period, after the officer returns to their\n usual station.\n\n (f) No other officers are entitled to accrue PDOs.\n\n 24.3 There will be no cash equivalent paid in lieu of PDOs.\n\n 24.4 Where a non-commissioned officer attends an approved course for more than 28 days, wherever\n possible such course is to include a PDO for each 28-day period.\n\n Provided that where this is not possible, and the non-commissioned officer is unable to access\n a PDO, then they are to be placed on a PDO during the current roster period or the next, on\n return to their usual station.\n\n 24.5 Officers relieving as commissioned officers will be subject to the PDO provisions at clause 18\n of this Agreement.\n\n 24.6 The rostering of non-commissioned officers on a PDO on a public holiday is not allowed.\n\n 24.7 The provisions of this clause may be varied by agreement between the QPUE and the Service\n for the purposes of special events, e.g. Commonwealth Games, Olympic Games, CHOGM,\n APEC, major prolonged sporting events, etc.\n\n25 Rosters\n\n 25.1 When developing rosters, clause 80 Health and Safety and Fatigue Management must be\n considered.\n\n 25.2 Shifts are to commence on the hour except for agreed flexible working arrangements where\n clause 84.4 of this Agreement or clause 8.2(j) of the Award applies.\n\n 25.3 To promote and encourage innovation in rostering methods and systems that may improve\n productivity, efficiency and occupational health and safety aspects, the limitation of 28 days for\n rosters may be waived and other award/certified agreement conditions may be varied on\n agreement between the Union and the Service, provided the following minimum criteria are\n observed:\n\n (a) Four rest days per fortnight;\n\n (b) No more than 10 consecutive shifts;\n\n (c) The average hours worked over the cycle of the roster must be 38 hours per week;\n\n 23\n\n (d) Ten-hour break requirements as per this Agreement.\n\n25.4 Police Officers required to work more than 10 consecutive ordinary shifts for whatever reason\n will be paid at overtime rates for each additional shift worked.\n\n25.5 At the request of the officer, the relevant OIC/Manager may agree that more than 10 consecutive\n ordinary shifts can be worked to accommodate personal circumstances. Where such agreement\n is reached, it will be recorded in writing and placed on the officer\u2019s personnel file. The officer\n and OIC/Manager will consider the occupational health and safety and fatigue management\n impacts of the request and subclause 25.4 above will not apply.\n\n25.6 Flexible rostering may include the practice of Lay Days (sometimes referred to as Z days). Such\n arrangements may occur locally subject to agreement between the relevant Region/Command\n and the relevant police officer provided that compliance with subclause 25.3 (a), (b), (c) and (d)\n is maintained.\n\n25.7 Rostering of OSA positions\n\n General Provisions\n\n (a) Rostering of OSA positions must comply with the following:\n\n i. Clause 43 Operational Shift Allowance;\n\n ii. Each officer is to be rostered off at least one full weekend in each 28-day\n roster. One full weekend is a consecutive Saturday and Sunday ;\n\n iii. Each officer will not be rostered to work more than 56 weekend days,\n accounted as 448 weekend hours, in an equity year. Provided that officers\n in a work unit performing 9 or 10-hour shifts may agree in writing with the\n Commissioner to extend the maximum number of weekend hours (448\n hours) worked as ordinary hours in an equity year up to a maximum of 56\n weekend shifts in lieu of the 448 hours limit;\n\n iv. Each officer will not be rostered to work more than 7 public holidays in an\n equity year;\n\n v. Where a public holiday falls on a weekend and an OSA officer is rostered\n and works the shift on that day, the day will count as both a public holiday\n worked and a weekend shift for OSA purposes;\n\n vi. Unless justifiable (as defined), officers will not be rostered to work more\n than 4 weekends in a row across adjoining rosters. Any officer required to\n work more than 4 weekends in a row across adjoining rosters, for whatever\n reason, will be paid at overtime rates for each additional weekend shift\n worked;\n\n vii. At the request of the officer, the relevant OIC/Manager may agree that\n more than 4 weekends in a row across adjoining rosters can be worked to\n accommodate personal circumstances.

A\n Saturday shift is one which commences on a Saturday and a Sunday shift is one\n which commences on a Sunday.\n\n (d) Where it is absolutely necessary that an employee is rostered more than 448\n weekend hours in a year, or in excess of the shift limitation agreed between the\n officer\u2019s work unit and the Commissioner (or delegate) pursuant to subclause\n 25.7(c) above, any weekend hours worked in excess of such hours will be paid as\n overtime.\n\n (e) Rostering arrangements will exclude the possibility of working in excess of three\n weekends in a 28-day roster. Where it is absolutely necessary that an officer work\n in excess of these rostered hours, this is to be paid as overtime.\n\n (f) Where an officer does not work a shift because of sick leave or carer\u2019s leave on a\n weekend shift, then this shift is not counted as a weekend shift worked for the\n purposes of the limits prescribed in provisions 25.7(c) and 25.7(d) above.\n\n i. Provided that, in the case of part shifts worked, such hours worked are to be\n deducted from the weekend limits as applicable.\n\n ii. It should be noted that officers in these circumstances are still entitled to 1\n weekend off in a 28-day roster.\n\n iii. Police Officers on short term absences from weekend shifts are required to\n provide a medical certificate (or for carer\u2019s leave not medically related, other\n evidence as required by the delegate) to cover each absence in order to\n receive the OSA. Officers who are absent from, or complete less than 4 hours\n of the rostered weekend shift and do not produce a medical certificate or\n other sufficient evidence of illness to satisfy a reasonable person , to cover\n the absence, will have their salary reduced by 2/19ths of their fortnightly OSA\n payment for each absence.\n\n Provided that any such absences for which a medical certificate is not\n produced will count towards the six working days allowed in any one year\n as prescribed at clause 21.1(b)(iii) of the Award.\n\n Officers who complete 4 hours or more of the rostered weekend shift, but do\n not complete the shift, will not have their salary reduced as outlined above.\n\n (g) In those cases where an employee is absent for a part or parts of the year, but during\n this time is in receipt of the OSA, the pro-rata arrangements referred to in subclause\n 25.7(h) will not apply.\n\n i. In such cases, police officers will not have to 'catch up' weekends to the 56-\n day maximum or to the same number as those other officers on the same roster,\n Equity in rostering must apply. However, these officers may be required to\n work their weekend days, up to 56, i.e. working their fair share of weekend\n days, if at stations where other officers have used up their 56 weekend days.\n\n ii. Police officers being rostered no more than 56 weekend days in a 12-month\n period and having at least one full weekend off in every 28-day roster will\n apply.\n\n 25\n\n iii. The pro-rata arrangements referred to in subclause 25.7(h) will apply to\n officers who, during the year, are promoted or transferred from a non-OSA\n position to an OSA position.\n\n (h) Pro-rata arrangements will apply:\n\n i. where a police officer is absent for a part of the year and during this absence\n is not receiving OSA (e.g. on long service leave or in a non-OSA position); or\n\n ii. when working a flexible hours (part-time) agreement equitably, on a pro-rata\n basis (e.g. 0.7 FTE officer working approximately 70% shift equity of a full-\n time officer on the same roster.)\n\nPublic Holiday provisions\n\n (i) A public holiday shift is one which commences on a public holiday.\n\n Police officers in receipt of the OSA will not be rostered to work more than 7 public\n holidays in an equity year.\n\n Provided that, pursuant to this Agreement, where it is absolutely necessary to work\n additional public holidays to the number specified above, these days are to be\n worked within ordinary rostered hours. These days will be paid at the rate of\n double time.\n\n (j) Where the police officer is not required to work on a public holiday shift, the\n provisions at subclause 59.1 may apply.\n\n (k) The rostering of non-commissioned officers on a PDO on a public holiday is not\n allowed.\n\n (l) In lieu of clause 20.1(h) of the Award, effective from the date of certification of\n this Agreement, annual leave will be exclusive of all public holidays. Therefore,\n any public holiday which occurs during any period of annual leave will not be\n debited from a police officer\u2019s annual leave accruals.\n\n (m) Only public holidays worked by a police officer are counted towards OSA\n maximums. Therefore, a public holiday occurring during any leave (including sick\n leave where a medical certificate is provided) will not count as a public holiday\n worked in an equity year in accordance with subclause 25.7(a)(iv).\n\nDistrict Rostering\n\n (n) At the discretion of the Commissioner (or delegate), OSA positions may be\n rostered within and/or across Districts (District Rostering) to maximise resource\n deployment and flexibility provided that:\n\n i. where practicable, police officers rostered to work at a location (other than\n their appointed division) within and/or across Districts should be notified of\n the change to the work location 7 days prior to the commencement of the\n roster period. This change of roster location should be for no longer than 2\n consecutive roster periods unless otherwise mutually agreed.\n\n ii. a police officer:\n\n 26\n\n \u2022 rostered to work in a location (other than their appointed division) that\n requires travel in excess of 40 kilometres from their current residence;\n or\n\n \u2022 the total travelling time each way is more than 30 minutes in addition\n to the time (excluding exceptional and unexpected delays) the officer\n would normally travel to and from their residence and usual station;\n\n will be entitled to travel time in accordance with clause 86 of this Agreement\n and clause 13.4 of the Award.\n\n iii. a police officer referred to in subclause 25.7(n)(ii) above will not be required\n to work at a location that requires travel in excess of 40 kilometres from their\n current residence for more than one roster period every 6 months unless\n mutually agreed between the officer and the delegate.\n\n iv. the parties agree that the rostering of a police officer to a location other than\n their appointed division will not occur or be used as a disciplinary sanction.\n However, the Service may roster a police officer to a location other than their\n appointed division as a risk mitigation strategy with regard to the\n Commissioner\u2019s responsibilities pursuant to section 4.8 of the PSAA.\n\n v. The parties acknowledge that District rostering may not be suitable in Districts\n that cover larger geographical areas.\n\n 25.8 Roster changes\n\n (a) Where there is a change to a police officer 's rostered hours, it is the responsibility\n OIC/Supervisor for ensuring the affected officer is notified, especially where the officer\n is on leave or rest days at the time the changes are made.\n\n (b) Where there is an operational requirement for a change in an employee\u2019s rostered\n location within or across Districts a minimum of 24 hours\u2019 notice is required. It is the\n responsibility of the supervisor and/or officer in charge for ensuring the affected\n employee is notified, especially where the employee is on leave or rest days at the time\n the changes are made.\n\n26 Overtime\n\n 26.1 In recognition of police officers \u2018Duty to Act\u2019 in accordance with the \u2018Office of Constable\u2019\n requiring a police officer to intervene at any time if they witness a crime or a situation\n involving imminent harm and subsequent disciplinary framework pursuant to the PSAA that\n enforces this \u2018Duty to Act; all non-commissioned officers whom are operationally available\n and OST qualified will be paid overtime at the rate of double time.\n\n 26.2 Those officers not eligible under subclause 26.1 will be paid overtime at the rate of time and\n a half for the first three hours and double time thereafter (except Sunday which is all double\n time).\n\n 26.3 Notwithstanding subclauses 26.1 and 26.2, the following officers will be paid overtime at the\n rate of double time:\n\n (a) all non-commissioned officers regarded as shift workers;\n\n (b) all non-commissioned officers in receipt of either Detective / Plain Clothes allowance;\n\n 27\n\n (c) all non-commissioned officers stationed at One or Two Officer Stations will be paid for\n all authorised overtime performed outside of their division or in accordance with clause\n 82.2(e);\n\n (d) all non-commissioned officers performing \u201cSpecial Duties\u201d on overtime;\n\n (e) all non-commissioned officers performing duties in a General Duties role (including an\n OIC);\n\n (f) all non-commissioned officers at Residential Beats;\n\n (g) all non-commissioned officers at Water Police establishments.\n\n 26.4 The minimum payment of 3 hours at overtime rates as prescribed at clause 18.7(b) of the\n Award includes the following scenarios:\n\n (a) Where a period of overtime of less than 3 hours is worked by a non-commissioned\n officer immediately prior to the commencement of an ordinary shift; and\n\n (b) Where a non-commissioned officer has returned home from an initial recall and is\n recalled a second time within 3 hours of commencement of the initial recall.\n\n 26.5 A non-commissioned officer who is not on call and is contacted outside of their ordinary hours\n and is subsequently required to perform duty at home is to be paid subject to the conditions in\n accordance with clause 18.5(i) of the Award.\n\nPART FOUR - ALLOWANCES\n\n27 Area Allowance\n\n 27.1 An annual area allowance paid fortnightly is payable to police officers at the following centres:\n Aurukun, Bamaga, Kowanyama, Lockhart River, Pormpuraaw, Yarrabah, Doomadgee,\n Mornington Island, Palm Island, Woorabinda, Cherbourg, Wujal Wujal, and Hope Vale.\n\n 27.2 The allowance will be paid to an officer who is appointed or rotated to an established position\n at one of the above centres while the employee is living and working in the community.\n\n 27.3 The allowance will be paid to an employee who relieves at one of the centres mentioned above\n for more than 6 weeks.

Any such accrued day off in lieu must be\n utilised on a rostered work day (excluding a public holiday).\n\n (c) For commissioned officers, the rostering of a programmed day off on a public holiday is\n not advocated.\n\n 57.2 For the purposes of subclause 57.1, a day where a part-time non-commissioned officer is not\n rostered on, is not considered a rest day, and subclause 57.1 does not change the rostering\n arrangements for part-time non-commissioned officers. That is, if a public holiday falls on a part-\n time non-commissioned officer\u2019s ordinary rostered hours, the OIC will make a decision whether\n the part-time non-commissioned officer attends work on that day and receive appropriate penalty\n rates or give the part-time non-commissioned officer a paid public holiday off. A part-time non-\n commissioned officer who works flexible days will be rostered on public holidays on a pro-rata\n basis.\n\n 57.3 An officer cannot be placed on call per clause 18.5 of the Award during their notional shift on a\n Public Holiday Off.

If subsequently called out during the officer\u2019s notional\n shift, the officer is entitled to normal public holiday ordinary time entitlements.\n\n 57.4 The Service is able to roster police officers on or off public holidays as appropriate. The decision\n as to who will or will not work will be made by the Commissioner (or delegate). Such decision\n will be based on need.\n\n 57.5 Where sick leave or carer\u2019s leave occurs during a public holiday on which a police officer has\n rostered ordinary hours, that leave will be debited for that day.\n\n 57.6 Other provisions relating to rostering on public holidays can be found at subclause 25(7)(i) to (m)\n (Rostering of OSA Positions).\n\n58 Annual Leave \u2013 Police Officers\n\n 58.1 Annual leave will accrue at the rate of 0.62466 hours for each calendar day of service (i.e. 6 weeks\n per annum); and in the Northern and Western parts of the State at 0.68712 hours for each calendar\n day of service (i.e. 6 weeks 3 days per annum).\n\n 58.2 A police officer permanently in receipt of the OSA, RSCS Allowance or the One and Two Officer\n Station Allowance and QPCYWA Allowance immediately prior to commencing a period of\n annual leave will have such allowances paid during the entirety of that period of annual leave, in\n lieu of leave loading.\n\n 40\n\n 58.3 The following will apply in lieu of clause 20.1(c) of the Award:\n\n For the purposes of this clause, the Northern and Western part of the State will be that part of the\n State lying to the northward or westward of a line, north of the 22nd parallel of south latitude and\n west of 147 degrees east longitude but including the township of Moranbah.\n\n 58.4 In lieu of clause 20.1(h) of the Award, annual leave will be exclusive of all public holidays.\n Therefore, any public holiday which occurs during any period of annual leave will not be debited\n from a police officer\u2019s annual leave accruals.\n\n59 Annual Leave Loading \u2013 Police Officers\n\n 59.1 Commissioned Officers\n\n (a) Leave loading of 17.5% on 4 weeks annual leave per year will be paid to all commissioned\n officers in the first pay of December each year for the previous calendar year.\n\n (b) In addition, shift working commissioned officers will be paid pro-rata shift work leave\n loading at the rate of 0.5749% of the officer\u2019s base rate for all time engaged in and/or\n occupying a continuous shift work position. The pro-rata shift work leave loading under this\n subclause will be paid fortnightly at the rate prescribed. Leave loading is not payable to\n those commissioned officers paid the Regional Duty Officers (RDO) Allowance as\n prescribed at clause 49 of this Agreement.\n\n 59.2 Non-Commissioned Officers\n\n Non-commissioned officers not in receipt of OSA, CPO Allowance, RSCS Allowance, TSIPLO\n Supervisor Allowance, One and Two Officer Station or the QPCYWA Allowance are paid leave\n loading at 17.5% on 4 weeks annual leave per year.\n\n60 Annual Leave Management \u2013 Police Officers\n\n 60.1 Police officers and the Service are jointly liable for the management of annual leave. The\n intention is for police officers to access their leave annually.\n\n 60.2 The Award allows police officers to accumulate up to two years\u2019 annual leave. However, this is\n not a right or an entitlement: it is a limit on accruals. The ability of the Service to direct officers\n to take annual leave is contained within the Award and the Industrial Relations Act 2016.\n\n 60.3 (a) Based on this ability, the Service will implement a State-wide annual leave target for all\n police officers each year. There will only be one target date each year, being 30 June.\n\n (b) The specified targets of accrued annual leave are 342 hours for police officers in the Northern\n and Western parts of the State and 304 hours for police officers in the remainder of the State.\n\n (c) See clause 20.1 of the Award for a description of the Northern and Western parts of the State.\n If officers do not voluntarily access appropriate leave, then they may be directed to take\n leave, provided that such direction is fair and reasonable.\n\n 60.4 It is not considered fair and reasonable to direct police officers to take annual leave in periods of\n less than one week generally, or two weeks for officers in the northern and western parts of the\n State who accrue extra leave.\n\n 60.5 In considering directions to take annual leave the Service should be flexible in relation to such\n matters as:\n\n 41\n\n \u2022 leave associated with the birth/adoption etc. of child/children;\n \u2022 a planned holiday, especially where a deposit is required;\n \u2022 family occasions such as engagements, weddings etc;\n \u2022 other special needs of the police officer.\n\n 60.5 Where an employee requests, annual leave may be accessed in periods of less than one or two\n weeks.\n\n61 Sick Leave \u2013 Police Officers\n\n 61.1 The Service continues to endorse the operation and maintenance of the Sick Leave Bank, as\n outlined at Schedule 4 of this Agreement.\n\n 61.2 Sick leave will accrue at the rate of 0.31233 hours for each calendar day of service (i.e. 15 days\n per annum).

Provided that any such absences for which a medical certificate is not produced\n will count towards the six working days allowed in any one year as prescribed at clause\n 21.1(b)(iii) of the Award.\n\n 61.4 In lieu of the requirement prescribed at clause 21.1(b)(i) of the Award to produce a certificate of\n a duly qualified medical practitioner, a police officer may produce to the Service a certificate\n from a duly qualified Allied Health Professional or Registered Nurse if they reside in a remote\n location and demonstrate an inability to access a medical practitioner.\n\n 61.5 Medical certificates obtained via tele health must involve verbal consultation between the officer\n and the medical practitioner.\n\n 61.6 Where a non-commissioned officer in receipt of OSA relieves as a commissioned officer for a\n period of 28 days or less and is absent on sick leave during the relieving period, such sick leave\n will be paid at their ordinary rate of pay as a non-commissioned officer including OSA.\n\n62 Maximum Limit for Payment of Consolidated Allowances \u2013 Police Officers\n\n 62.1 Consolidated allowances are OSA, Residential Beats Allowance, One and Two Officer Station\n Allowance, PCYC Coordinator / Project Booyah Allowance, QPCYWA Allowance, CPO\n Allowance (Controllers), Regional Duty Officers (RDO) Allowance, RSCS Allowance and\n TSIPLO Supervisor Allowance.\n\n 62.2 Consolidated allowances will be paid for the first 26 weeks that an employee is absent on sick\n leave, including accessing the Sick Leave Bank.\n\n 62.3 Where the absence will extend beyond 26 weeks, the Commissioner (or delegate) will assess on\n a case-by-case basis whether the payment of the consolidated allowance should continue beyond\n 26 weeks, or whether it should cease.\n\n63 Paid Parental Leave - Police Officers\n\n The conditions and entitlements prescribed in the ministerial directive relating to Paid Parental Leave\n pursuant to the Public Sector Act 2022, as amended from time to time will apply to police officers.\n\n 42\n\n64 Long Service Leave - Police Officers\n\n The conditions and entitlements prescribed in the ministerial directive relating to Long Service Leave\n pursuant to the Public Sector Act 2022, as amended from time to time will apply to police officers.\n\n65 Critical Incident Leave \u2013 Police Officers\n\n 65.1 A police officer is entitled to a maximum of 3 days paid \u201cCritical Incident Leave\u201d when the officer\n has been involved in a critical incident.\n\n 65.2 A \u201ccritical incident\u201d will be defined in accordance with section 5A.2 (as amended) of the PSAA\n or in addition will include:\n\n (a) incidents where a reportable death occurs in the course of or as a result of police operations\n as prescribed at s.8(3)(h) (as amended) of the Coroner\u2019s Act 2003;\n\n (b) a highly traumatic incident in which a person dies or is admitted to hospital for treatment of\n serious injuries.\n\n 65.3 Critical Incident Leave will be in addition to any other paid leave the police officer is entitled to\n and will be granted by the Commissioner subject to operational requirements.\n\n66 Support for Police Officers Affected by Domestic and Family Violence\n\n The conditions and entitlements prescribed in the ministerial directive relating to Support for Employees\n affected by Domestic and Family Violence pursuant to the Public Sector Act 2022, as amended from\n time to time will apply to police officers.\n\n67 Bereavement Leave - Police Officers\n\n The conditions and entitlements about Bereavement Leave only as prescribed in the ministerial directive\n relating to Special Leave pursuant to the Public Sector Act 2022, as amended from time to time will\n apply to police officers.\n\nPART SIX \u2013 TRANSFERS, RELOCATION EXPENSES AND TRAVELLING ENTITLEMENTS\n\nLATERAL TRANSFERS \u2013 POLICE OFFICERS\n\n68 Introduction\n\n 68.1 The lateral transfer process applies in lieu of clause 26 of the Award.\n\n 68.2 The Commissioner (or delegate) may laterally transfer a police officer (excluding OICs and\n DDOs) under their command provided there is mutual agreement. There will be no entitlement\n to transfer expenses, except in exceptional circumstances. Where the police officer\u2019s resultant\n travelling distance between their residence and new place of work exceeds 40 kilometres, the\n parties will ensure the Health and Safety and Fatigue Management provisions outlined at clause\n 80 are considered. Such transfers will not alter an police officer\u2019s tenure. It is recognised that\n this provision is suitable for addressing a flexible work application where a proposed arrangement\n is not operationally viable at a police officer\u2019s current location.\n\n 43\n\n This process may occur without referring an application or submission to the Transfer Advisory\n Committee (TAC); provided that the TAC is advised of such transfers in the meeting agenda in a\n manner similar to \u201crotations\u201d.\n\n 68.3 The lateral transfer process set out in this Agreement does not apply to transfers which form part\n of a disciplinary sanction under the PSAA. Such discipline transfers are to be dealt with under the\n PSAA.\n\n 68.4 Lateral transfers provide a facility for the transfer of police officers at their substantive rank to\n other positions and/or locations in limited circumstances without the need to advertise and fill\n positions on an open merit basis.\n\n 68.5 Where a lateral transfer occurs, the police officer will not suffer a reduction in ordinary salary,\n unless clause 68.10 applies.\n\n 68.6 Lateral transfers may be initiated either by the Commissioner (or delegate) or through application\n by the police officer.\n\n 68.7 These provisions will not apply to any appointments, postings, movements or transfers of a\n Constable up to and including their appointment upon confirmation, unless there are exceptional\n circumstances.\n\n 68.8 Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement, the Commissioner has the\n discretion to initiate a directed transfer of a police officer at their substantive rank to other\n positions and/or locations.\n\n 68.9 OIC and DDO positions will be maintained for filling via the open merit process. In exceptional\n circumstances supported applicants currently holding the position of OIC or DDO may be\n considered for a lateral transfer into a position with equal remuneration and similar location\n profile in another location.\n\n 68.10 Police officers promoted to their current position and are more than three months from completing\n the minimum tenure, and who choose to apply for an officer-initiated transfer must voluntarily\n relinquish their promotion and revert to their previous rank to receive TAC support.\n\n69 Transfer Advisory Committee (TAC)\n\n 69.1 For the purposes of lateral transfers, there will be a Transfer Advisory Committee (TAC)\n established to advise the Commissioner (or delegate) regarding applications for lateral transfers.\n\n 69.2 Membership of the Committee comprises representatives of:\n\n \u2022 The relevant Union (QPUE or the QPCOUE);\n\n \u2022 The Service (including Human Resources Division HR Services (Chairperson), Employee\n Relations and operational representative/s).\n\n 69.3 TAC supports a police officer out of their current location, not into a particular position, and\n notwithstanding any advice provided by the Committee, the Commissioner (or delegate) has the\n final decision-making authority.\n\n 69.4 Any split outcomes at TAC are to be decided by the Commissioner (or delegate).\n Note: At the time of certification, the delegate is the Executive Director, Human Resources\n Division.\n\n 44\n\n 69.5 A police officer aggrieved by a final decision by the delegate may submit a Stage 1 grievance to\n the delegate, as the decision maker.\n\n 69.6 In addition to providing advice to the Commissioner (or delegate) on lateral transfers, the\n Committee will inform itself of relevant issues affecting the transfer of police officers generally\n throughout the Service and provide appropriate advice accordingly to the Commissioner (or\n delegate) with a view to resolution of the issue.\n\n 69.7 The Committee will meet fortnightly or as required and for the purpose of providing advice to the\n Commissioner (or delegate), the TAC will have a Minutes Secretary, provided by Human\n Resources Division\n\n 69.8 The Committee will provide advice to the Commissioner (or delegate) within 30 days of receiving\n any application for lateral transfers. Should any party represented on the Committee fail to provide\n advice on their position within the said 30 days, the Commissioner (or delegate) may decide the\n application on the advice already provided.\n\n70 The Application Process\n\n 70.1 (a) Any police officer may apply for a lateral transfer which will be forwarded to the Committee\n by the relevant delegate. This delegate will indicate support or otherwise for the application,\n together with reasons.\n\n (b) Similarly, any senior executive officer who wishes to initiate a lateral transfer of a police\n officer (management initiated transfer) will forward a submission to the Committee\n indicating the reasons why, together with a copy of the individual police officer\u2019s position\n on the proposed transfer.\n\n (c) The applications/submissions mentioned at (a) and (b) hereof, will be considered by the\n TAC. This Committee will indicate to the Commissioner (or delegate) whether or not the\n application/submission is supported.\n\n (d) All applications are to include the specified position titles and locations for which the\n employee will be considered. (Note: members will only be considered for those specified\n locations).\n\n (e) Provided that the requested/proposed location may not be the ultimate location to which the\n employee is transferred.\n\n (f) Any application for a lateral transfer is to be processed in such a way to reach the Minutes\n Secretary of the TAC within 28 days of receipt of the application by the Service.\n\n (g) Any application for a lateral transfer if supported by the TAC will remain current for 12\n months only. Applicants may reconsider their individual circumstances and re-submit\n subsequent applications to the TAC before or after this time.\n\n (h) In the cases of employees who seek lateral transfers under the operational factors specified\n in clause 71 at either subclauses (10) Swaps; or (12)(b) & (c) of Partner's Employment; or\n (13) Personal Reasons, cost of transfer will generally not be paid. Upon request, the\n Commissioner (or delegate) will determine if cost of transfer should be paid (each case to be\n considered on its individual circumstances). Costs of transfer includes all entitlements at\n clause 73. To remove any doubt this includes packing and travel days.\n\n (i) None of the decisions referred to in (h) above in relation to costs will be used as a precedent\n in dealing with any other matter relating to costs of transfers.\n\n 45\n\n (j) The Commissioner (or delegate) will ensure that an employee making application meets the\n requirements of the roles of the particular positions nominated.\n\n71 Operational Factors\n\n The following operational factors do not give an automatic right to a lateral transfer and may be utilised\n by either management or a police officer in making submissions/applying for a lateral transfer. The\n factors allow consideration of applications/submissions:\n\n 71.1 Organisational Restructuring: Where, to meet service delivery requirements, the Service closes\n or opens a station, section or establishment; the Service increases or decreases the staffing levels\n of a station, section or establishment; the reclassification of positions; i.e. workplace restructuring.\n\n 71.2 Expressions of Interest/Transfer at Level Opportunities: This is a process whereby the\n Commissioner (or delegate) selects a police officer from the relevant closed merit pool. Where\n there is a dispute regarding tenure then the implementation of any lateral transfer under this\n operational factor will be delayed until the dispute is resolved.\n\n 71.3 Health or Compassionate Grounds:\n\n (a) Health grounds apply where a police officer or family member has a need to have access\n to appropriate medical services, or on medical grounds has a need to vacate, or transfer to,\n a particular location. Each application pursuant to this operational factor must be supported\n by relevant medical reports.\n\n (b) Compassionate grounds include family matters sufficient to support a police officer\u2019s\n transfer. Where appropriate TAC may request documentary evidence on a case-by-case\n basis.\n\n 71.4 Service in Isolated/Difficult Postings: Where a police officer has completed tenure in an\n isolated/difficult location and seeks a return to less isolated/difficult areas or is having difficulty\n achieving another position because of the limited experience/skills resulting from service in an\n isolated/difficult location.\n\n 71.5 Service in Particular Postings:\n\n (a) These are those positions from which there may be a need to remove an officer due to the\n nature of the duties (e.g. CPIU, FCU, CPO); or\n\n (b) Because of the specialised nature of the duties in the position [e.g., Prosecutions, CCC] the\n police officer can demonstrate difficulty achieving another position at level outside of the\n current area of operation. Police officers making application pursuant to this operational\n factor must have completed minimum tenure in their current position, demonstrate that they\n have applied for positions on the rank and have received feedback that the specialised\n nature of their current position is limiting their ability to win other positions.\n\n 71.6 To/from Surplus: \"To surplus\" applies when another operational factor warrants a transfer of that\n police officer to surplus. \u201cTo surplus\u201d may be applied where a police officer is required for a\n specific task for a defined period of time not being relieving e.g. projects. \u201cFrom surplus\u201d applies\n where it is necessary to fill a substantive position by a police officer who is currently surplus.\n Closed merit will apply where there is more than one police officer of the rank in surplus.\n\n This factor also applies where a police officer is transferred to or from a position lower than their\n substantive rank i.e. the police officer is offset against another position.\n\n 71.7 External Agencies: This applies when an officer is to be transferred to or from an\n agency/organisation external to the Service e.g. Crime and Corruption Commission.\n\n 46\n\n71.8 Rotations:\n\n (a) The areas of application include for example, Watchhouses and stations in Aboriginal and\n Torres Strait Islander communities and hard-to-fill rural and remote locations including\n plain clothes and specialist positions.\n\n (b) Police officers who have been through a merit-based process for a position identified for\n the purposes of rotation of staff (including those rotations occurring under clause 91) and\n wishes to remain for a longer period can do so through an application to TAC if mutually\n acceptable to all parties. Previous time at the location will be included for the purposes\n of tenure.\n\n71.9 Positions requiring pre-training: This refers to situations where an officer has to receive training\n prior to being able to take up a position and there is a need, having received this training to transfer\n the police officer to a particular location to utilise these developed skills e.g. SOCO and\n prosecutions but not, for example, detective training. Police officers will be advised in writing\n prior to commencing training where they will be required to perform such duty after completion\n of the training.\n\n71.10 Swaps: A mutually agreed request initiated by two or more police officers and agreed by the\n Commissioner (or delegates) for an exchange of similar positions at the same rank.\n\n71.11 Resource Management:\n\n (a) This operational factor covers grounds where a transfer is necessary because of a\n breakdown of personal relationships between the employee, of any rank, and other police\n officers; or that police officer and the local community.\n\n (b) Further, this factor applies where staff numbers have fallen below safe operational levels.\n Should there be no applicants for these positions after advertisement State-wide and there\n are no volunteers, the Service may consider the implementation of directed transfers.\n Provided that prior to so doing, the process of selection of appointees occurs by a process\n agreed between the Commissioner and the QPUE or QPCOUE. Agreement will not be\n unreasonably withheld or delayed by either party.\n\n (c) Where it has been clearly demonstrated to TAC that an officer is not coping in their current\n position and management has taken all fair and reasonable actions to assist them in that\n position, the Service may seek to relocate the police officer. Provided that any costs\n associated with or resulting from the relocation are borne by the Service. Further, reports\n have to be provided by management as to what has been the problem and what has been\n done to rectify it and, a report from the police officer concerned regarding the proposed\n transfer. These are to be provided to TAC members at least 7 days before TAC meets.\n\n71.12 Partner\u2019s Employment:\n\n (a) This is where a Service employee (police officer or staff member is transferred, and their\n partner is a police officer. This factor then allows the transfer of the partner in the case of\n the partner being a police officer.\n\n 47\n\n (b) This factor also applies where a police officer seeks a transfer because the police officer's\n partner [not being a Service employee] receives a transfer as a result of a direction by the\n partner's employer to relocate.\n\n (c) This factor may also apply where the request for a transfer is at the police officer 's\n instigation and is purely to suit their partner's choice to relocate their employment where\n the partner is not a Service employee.\n\n 71.13 Personal Reasons: This applies where a transfer is sought by a police officer on personal grounds\n which are not covered by any other operational factor, and which are not necessarily in the\n operational interests of the Service. These reasons must be unique and compelling. This factor\n does not include reasons related to cost of travel nor purchase of a residence in another location.\n Utilisation of this operational factor will only be on a case-by-case basis and will be of no\n precedent value.\n\n72 The Appointment Process\n\n 72.1 For consistency and transparency, the final responsibility for the placement of employees on the\n lateral transfer list into a position will rest with the delegate. The identification and selection of\n a police officer on the lateral transfer list for placement into a position (other than via transfer at\n level/EOI opportunities appearing in the Police Gazette) will include the following:\n\n (a) Human Resources Division will nominate police officers from the lateral transfer list for\n selection by the delegated officer, based on the following principles:\n\n i. The position falls within the scope of a police officer\u2019s nominated preferences;\n\n ii. The length of time a police officer has been on the lateral transfer list (preference to \u2018first\n in, first out\u2019 basis, wherever possible) \u2013 if more than one police officer has the same TAC\n approval date, all will be considered for nomination;\n\n iii. The impact of extraordinary circumstances relating to police officers on the lateral\n transfer list (circumstance will only be deemed \u2018extraordinary\u2019 on a case-by-case basis);\n\n iv. A police officer\u2019s refusal of placement opportunity/s will impact their eligibility to\n maintain their relative priority on the transfer list.\n\n (b) Unless there are multiple police officers nominated for transfer into a position, the placement\n of a nominated police officer will be on the basis of a suitability assessment undertaken by\n the delegated officer. A suitability assessment will include an assessment of whether the\n applicant has the skills and abilities necessary to meet the requirements of the role to a\n satisfactory level, given reasonable training, re-training and on-the-job experience, and are\n fit to undertake the role with reasonable adjustment, if required.\n\n (c) Where a delegated officer does not approve the lateral transfer of a nominated police officer\n into a position, the delegated officer must provide written reasons for the decision to the\n police officer/s.\n\n (d) Police officers who were nominated to be assessed for a position, but who were not selected\n by the delegated officer, may lodge a grievance if they are dissatisfied with the reasons\n provided by the delegated officer.\n\n 48\n\n (e) Closed selection may be used in conjunction with operational factors if together, they provide\n a more appropriate basis for selecting, from employees of the same rank, an employee to\n transfer into the position (including where multiple police officers on the lateral transfer list\n are nominated pursuant to clause 72.1(b) for placement into a position).\n\nTRANSFER ENTITLEMENTS\n\n73 General\n\n 73.1 Subject to clause 70.1(i), an employee covered by this Agreement is eligible for the transfer\n entitlements provided in this Agreement if the Commissioner (or delegate) is of the view that a\n change of residence is required.\n\n 73.2 Provided that PLOs, TSIPLOs and AWOs are only entitled to transfer entitlements when\n transferred on merit or on compassionate grounds.\n\n 73.3 Unless approved by a level 2 delegate (or higher), an employee is only entitled to the payment or\n reimbursement of expenses and other conditions for transfer after formal notification of their\n transfer in the Queensland Police Service Gazette. An order of transfer for an employee who is\n promoted/appointed to a gazetted vacancy is effective upon the conclusion of the review period\n and/or finalisation of any reviews, whichever is the latter.\n\n 73.4 Transfer entitlements are set in accordance with the rates, standards and conditions applicable to\n public sector officers through the ministerial directive relating to Transfer and Appointment\n Expenses pursuant to the Public Sector Act 2022, as amended or replaced from time to time.\n\n 73.5 Where a police officer enters into accommodation in QPS/Government housing or enters into\n private rental leases of periods of 6 months or more, the police officer is regarded as having\n obtained permanent accommodation for purposes of entitlements for temporary accommodation\n and storage of effects.\n\n 73.6 First year constables may treat a former principal place of residence as their principal place of\n residence for purposes of transfer entitlements occurring as a result of their 2nd year allocation.\n\n 73.7 Overpayments relating to conveyancing fees on sale identified as a result of a sale and purchase\n of principal residence or land not occurring within the specified two-year period outlined in the\n abovementioned directive, will be repayable by the police officer immediately upon completion\n of the two-year period or date of cessation of employment if occurs earlier.\n\n 73.8 Appointment expenses in accordance with the abovementioned directive for new employees will\n be allowed at the discretion of the Commissioner.\n\n 73.9 Costs for storage of effects as prescribed at section 20 of the Transfer and Appointment Expenses\n directive (as amended or replaced) may be approved at the discretion of the relevant Assistant\n Commissioner in cases where the police officer has entered into permanent accommodation in\n Government-owned or QPS housing at RLIP or Area Allowance locations.\n\n 73.10 Additional information relating to the following can be found in the Service\u2019s HR Policy \u2018Transfer\n Entitlements \u2013 Police Officers Guideline\u2019 as amended:\n\n (a) documentary evidence;\n\n (b) definitions;\n\n (c) roles and responsibilities.\n\n 49\n\n73.11 The following provisions relating to transfer entitlements also apply and where inconsistent with\n provisions contained in the abovementioned directive will have precedence:\n\n (a) Accommodation/meals prior to departure and upon arrival\n\n i.Entitlement\n\n An employee will be reimbursed actual expenses for themselves and any accompanying\n family for accommodation and meals necessarily incurred after furniture has been\n uplifted and whilst waiting to travel to the new centre, and on the night of arrival at the\n new centre. In addition, and only in cases where permanent accommodation at the new\n centre has been secured, reimbursement of actual expenses for accommodation and\n meals may be approved in specific circumstances and on a case-by-case basis by the\n delegated officer for the period after date of arrival at the new centre and up to date of\n arrival of the police officer\u2019s furniture and effects. For example, a police officer may\n be required to arrive at the new centre to commence their first shift on a date prior to\n the actual arrival of their furniture and effects.\n\n If an employee's furniture and effects are uplifted from the former centre greater than\n two days prior to the employee departing to the new centre, then the Commissioner (or\n delegate) will determine whether actual expenses will be reimbursed, or whether the\n temporary accommodation provisions will apply. If the delay in the police officer\n departing their former centre is a result of the actions of the Service, then actual\n expenses will be reimbursed.\n\n ii. Eligibility\n\n I. Hotel, motel, registered lodging house or caravan park\n\n All actual and reasonable expenses. Reasonable expenses and reasonable\n accommodation standards will be as determined by the Commissioner (or\n delegate). Receipts are required.\n\n II.

Each request for reimbursement\n will be considered on an individual basis. Such reimbursement of expenses is subject\n to the following conditions:\n\n 50\n\n I. permanent accommodation is actually secured and is available on arrival at\n the new centre; or\n\n II. in the event of temporary accommodation expenses incurred following\n transfer being claimed under the directive, the maximum amount claimable is\n to be reduced by the amount actually paid under subclause 73.11(b).\n\n ii.

It is the responsibility of the\n employee to bear the costs for removal and insurance for any volume in excess of fifty\n cubic metres.\n\n An employee with more than 2 family members (including the employee) is entitled to\n the transportation of additional furniture and effects calculated on the basis of the\n number of members of the employee\u2019s family. The additional entitlement is calculated\n in accordance with the following table:\n\n Number Meterage\n in Family Entitlement\n 3 or 4 60 cubic metres\n 5 65 cubic metres\n 6 70 cubic metres\n 7 75 cubic metres\n 8 80 cubic metres\n\n 51\n\n 9 85 cubic metres\n 10 90 cubic metres\n\n An officer with furniture and effects in excess of the relevant entitlement may seek\n approval for the Service to pay for the transportation of the actual volume of furniture\n and effects. The Service will only meet the additional costs if there are extenuating\n circumstances that would make the transportation of additional volume reasonable.\n\nRELOCATION EXPENSES\n\n74 Relocation Expenses for Officers Retiring from the Service\n\n 74.1 Relocation expenses for police officers retiring from the Service apply to all police officers\n subject to this Agreement except for casual employees.\n\n 74.2 Entitlements are accessible when an officer meets one of the following criteria:\n\n (a) they retire in accordance with section 8.2 of the PSAA; or\n\n (b) the officer is retiring on the ground of ill health in accordance with section 8.3 of the PSAA;\n or\n\n (c) the officer is deceased.\n\n 74.3 Relocation expenses/conditions for police officers retiring from the Service will be in accordance\n with the ministerial directive relating to Relocation Expenses for Officers Retiring from the\n Service pursuant to the Public Sector Act 2022, as amended or replaced from time to time.\n However, time limits referred in the directive may be extended to allow the Commissioner (or\n delegate) to advertise and fill vacancies.\n\n75 Relocation Expenses for Widows and Widowers of Deceased Officers\n\n Relocation expenses for families of deceased police officers residing with the police officer at the time\n of death are in accordance with the application and entitlements prescribed at clause 74 above.\n\nTRAVELLING ENTITLEMENTS\n\n76 Domestic Travel - Application and Entitlement\n\n 76.1 Subject to clause 76 herein and clause 86, travelling entitlements are set in accordance with the\n rates, standards and conditions applicable to public service officers through the ministerial\n directive relating to Domestic Travelling and Relieving Expenses pursuant to the Public Sector\n Act 2022, as amended or replaced from time to time.

Likewise, an officer subject to this clause may be directed to\n perform duties at nearby work locations/stations across a District boundary for the same\n reasons.\n\n 78.7 A change of work location in accordance with this clause may be initiated by the Service\n subject to the following safeguards:\n\n (a) The change in work location should not change the rank or duties of the officer\n transferred unless agreed.\n\n (b) A permanent change in workplace location that requires travel in excess of 40\n kilometres from their current residence or total travelling time each way of more than\n 30 minutes in addition to the time (excluding exceptional and unexpected delays) the\n police officer would normally travel to and from their residence and previous\n station/work location will be entitled to the Transfer Entitlements prescribed at clause\n 73 of this Agreement if they choose to relocate their residence closer to the new\n workplace.\n\n (c) The parties agree that a change of workplace under this clause will not occur or be\n used as a disciplinary sanction. However, it is acknowledged that the service may\n change an employee\u2019s work location as a risk mitigation strategy with regard to the\n Commissioner\u2019s responsibilities pursuant to section 4.8 of the PSAA.\n\n 78.8 Where a police officer objects to a permanent change of workplace made under this clause the\n employee can challenge the decision through the existing grievance and dispute resolution\n processes.\n\n79 Higher Duties\n\n Commissioned and Non-Commissioned Officers\n\n 79.1 The following applies in lieu of clause 12.7 of the Award:\n\n (a) Where a police officer is directed or rostered to fill temporarily the office of a police officer\n of higher rank, or a vacant office of higher rank to which an appointment has not been\n made, the police officer will be paid, subject to subclauses (c) and (e) below, extra\n remuneration at the minimum salary rate applicable to the higher rank provided that the\n police officer:\n\n \u2022 fills temporarily the position for more than 3 consecutive shifts not including rest days;\n and\n\n \u2022 performs all of those duties and accepts all of those responsibilities associated with\n the position.\n\n (b) \u2018Fill temporarily\u2019 includes those relieving periods where the incumbent police officer is\n absent on PDOs.\n\n (c) Where a Constable who has been remunerated at pay point 1.6 relieves at the rank of Senior\n Constable, the amount of extra remuneration payable to such police officer will be the\n difference between pay point 1.6 and pay point 2.2.\n\n 55\n\n (d) In each case the amount of extra remuneration payable to a police officer will be the\n difference between the police officer\u2019s salary and the minimum salary prescribed for the\n rank to which the police officer relieves.\n\n (e) Where a Senior Constable remunerated at pay point 2.10 relieves at the rank of Sergeant,\n the amount of extra remuneration payable to such police officer will be the difference\n between pay point 2.10 and pay point 3.2.\n\n (f) If a police officer who is temporarily filling an office of higher rank goes on annual or sick\n leave, such leave will not be deemed to interrupt the period of performance of such duties\n if the employee resumes the same duties on the return from leave.\n\n (g) All leave (other than annual leave or long service leave) taken during the first 12 months\n of any continuous period of higher duties, is paid at the police officer\u2019s substantive salary.\n After 12 months of continuous higher duties, a police officer\u2019s leave is paid at the higher\n duties rate provided:\n\n \u2022 all leave taken during the preceding 12 months was paid leave or leave that may be\n credited as service; and\n\n \u2022 the leave falls within the period of higher duties (except where the employee takes\n paid parental leave).\n\n79.2 Subject to subclause 79.1(c) and (e) above, where the office of higher rank is an OSA position a\n police officer will receive, in addition to any higher duties, the OSA calculated on the minimum\n salary prescribed for the higher rank.\n\n79.3 The following applies to non-commissioned officers only:\n\n (a) Subject to the following conditions, a non-commissioned officer performing higher duties\n at the ranks of Senior Constable, Sergeant or Senior Sergeant will not be financially\n disadvantaged relative to their substantive wage and composite allowance if they access\n any paid leave during or immediately after a period of higher duties.\n\n (b) The provisions of (a) above only applies:\n\n \u2022 to leave taken in the 12-month period after date of commencement of any continuous\n period of higher duties; and\n\n \u2022 where the officer has been in receipt of the composite allowance for a minimum\n period of 52 weeks prior to commencement of higher duties.\n\n (c) The conditions applicable to payment of the composite allowance apply (e.g. non-payment\n of leave loading when receiving OSA) whenever the substantive wage and composite\n allowance is paid under this clause.\n\n79.4 Subject to subclause 79.5 below, where the office of higher rank is not an OSA position, and\n the officer is currently permanently in an OSA position, they will continue to receive the OSA\n calculated on the officer's substantive pay point for a period up to and including 28 calendar\n days.\n\n79.5 Whilst relieving as a commissioned officer, officers are subject to the same terms and conditions\n as commissioned officers.\n\n 56\n\n 79.6 Therefore, subject to subclause 61.6 of this Agreement, officers relieving in a commissioned\n officer position will not maintain the OSA or OIC payment from the date of commencing such\n relieving.\n\n 79.7 During maintenance of the OSA referred to in subclause 79.4 above, under no circumstances\n will shift and weekend penalty rates, public holiday penalty payments, leave loading payments,\n Overtime Considerations payments, One and Two Officer Station Allowance, PCYC Zonal\n Coordinator / Project Booyah Allowance, QPCYWA Allowance, Beats Allowance, CPO\n Allowance, RSCS Allowance or TSIPLO Supervisor Allowance be paid in addition to the OSA.\n\n80 Health and Safety and Fatigue Management\n\n 80.1 The Service, its supervisors and police officers will consider their respective obligations under\n the Work Health and Safety Act 2011 in the performance of their duties.\n\n 80.2 In particular, officers and supervisors are referred to the QPS Fatigue Management Policy and\n Guidelines found on the QPS Intranet.\n\n 80.3 The Service\u2019s fatigue management and health and safety policies must be considered and\n complied with in relation to all areas of employment. The following is a list of employment\n issues to be considered under this clause including, but not limited to:\n\n \u2022 Performance of special services;\n \u2022 Hours of work including rostering and overtime;\n \u2022 Travelling time;\n \u2022 Secondary employment.\n\n81 One and Two Officer Stations\n\n The parties agree to the following conditions affecting one and two officer stations.\n\n Where written agreement is reached between the parties in relation to a specific three or four officer\n station, officers at that station will receive the composite allowance, all relevant entitlements and work\n in accordance with the conditions as prescribed at clauses 42 and 81 of this Agreement. Agreement by\n either party relating to any specific location may be renegotiated at any time due to a change in\n circumstances. Existing agreed administrative arrangements applicable as at date of certification of this\n Agreement are Julia Creek, Russell Island and Macleay Island.\n\n 81.1 Weekend Work and Public Holidays\n\n Conditions relating to weekend work and public holidays as prescribed at subclauses 25.7(a)(ii),\n 25.7(a)(iii), 25.7(a)(iv), 25.7(d), 25.7)(i) to 25.7(m), 36 and 39 of this Agreement apply.\n\n 81.2 Overtime and Travel\n\n (a) Where a police officer is directed to perform duty outside of their division by the District\n Officer or a delegated officer and that duty is on a rest day or is outside of their rostered\n hours for that day, they will be paid overtime for the duty so performed.\n\n (b) Work for which a direction from a District Officer or a delegated officer is not required\n will not attract an overtime payment, irrespective of whether or not the officer seeks such\n a direction.\n\n 57\n\n (c) Where an officer is rostered to perform duty at an event (e.g. local rodeo) outside of their\n division, they will be paid overtime for all hours worked in excess of ordinary hours. The\n officer will be given at least 48 hours\u2019 notice of the requirement.\n\n (d) In performing duty in accordance with subclause 81.2 (a)&(c) above, a police officer is to\n be paid at ordinary rates for travel undertaken outside rostered hours in accordance with\n clause 86 of this Agreement.\n\n (e) Notwithstanding the above provisions, a District Officer may approve payment at overtime\n rates of any overtime performed within the officer\u2019s division by an officer at a One or Two\n Officer Station, which does not relate to the officer\u2019s normal duties. Such duties for\n example may include the following:\n\n \u2022 where Road Policing/Traffic Branch provides additional funding to perform duties\n associated with road safety;\n\n \u2022 where Crime Command provides additional funding to perform duties associated with\n policing the prevalence of drugs in local communities;\n\n \u2022 where an officer provides a response to a declared disaster;\n\n \u2022 where an officer, who has undertaken appropriate training, performs specialist duties\n (such as Search and Rescue or Forensic Crash duties).\n\n81.3 Transfer\n\n Police officers on transfer out of one and two officer stations may be required to continue duty at\n that one or two officer station pending the arrival of the officer\u2019s replacement. However, the\n officer will not be held more than 16 weeks after the gazettal of the officer\u2019s transfer or more than\n the period of the review, whichever is the longer. This provision may only be implemented on\n the proviso that the position the officer is transferring to be kept vacant pending the officer\u2019s\n arrival. This provision will not change the gazetted effective date of the officer\u2019s promotion.\n\n81.4 One Weekend in Four Free of Calls\n\n (a) Officers will be entitled to have a minimum of one weekend or any two consecutive days,\n and a further two days in each 28-day period free of all calls. The taking of these additional\n days free of calls will be by negotiation with the District Officer and subject to operational\n requirements. These days may be taken in conjunction with other days free of calls. Where\n both or one of the additional days free of calls cannot be rostered due to operational reasons,\n they may be deferred to the next 28-day period, however, must not be carried over into\n further periods. Officers at one and two officer stations will endeavour to make reciprocal\n arrangements with their neighbouring division for this to occur.\n\n (b) Such reciprocal arrangements will only occur where there is agreement between the\n relevant officers. Where this reciprocal arrangement is not able to be negotiated by the\n relevant officers, the Service will make arrangements to ensure the officer will receive two\n weekends in four free of all calls.\n\n81.5 Covering Additional Stations\n\n (a) Police officers will not be required to cover more than one extra single officer station and\n only for periods of paid leave at that extra station or to enable officers to attend training or\n for other reasons as agreed between the Service and the QPUE. No overtime will be\n\n 58\n\n payable for duty performed in these circumstances during the normal rostered hours at that\n officer\u2019s home station. However, overtime will be payable for all duty performed in the\n neighbouring division occurring outside of ordinary hours or on rest days. The continuous\n period for covering arrangements should not exceed 16 weeks unless justified. When a\n Two Officer Station has only one officer, that officer will not be required to cover any other\n station (i.e. single officer station) where the appointed officer at that station is absent.\n\n (b) The Buddy System occurs when neighbouring divisions work harmoniously together to\n obtain a balance between the operational requirements of the Service and officers\u2019 work/life\n balance. Neighbouring stations may include stations across patrol group, district and\n regional boundaries. All parties recognise the importance that the informal \u201cBuddy\n System\u201d plays at all one and two officer stations and that this arrangement enables\n flexibility and improved productivity.\n\n (c) Subclause (a) above will not apply where the Buddy System is in operation whereby one\n or two officer stations combine for the purpose of enabling the officer/s attached to them\n to have one weekend in four free of all calls within their respective division on a rotational\n basis.\n\n (d) It is acknowledged that subclause (a) above will not apply where other local arrangements\n agreed to by both officer/s and management are applied in exceptional circumstances.\n\n81.6 Leaving the Division\n\n (a) Police Officers at one officer stations, and two officer stations which are reduced to one for\n whatever reason, must give prior notice in a timely manner unless justifiable (as defined)\n to the District Officer and the adjoining divisions of their intention to leave their division\n on rest days or PDOs. When they remain in the division, they are still available for work\n when an urgent or immediate policing response is required.\n\n (b) The District Officer can direct the officer concerned to remain in the division only if there\n is a warranted and justifiable reason. It follows then that the notice of intention to leave\n the division is to be given in a timely manner unless justifiable (as defined), thus affording\n the District Officer an opportunity to respond.\n\n (c) In relation to a District Officer\u2019s response at (b) above, District Officers should consider\n the following issues when responding to a notice made under (a) above:\n\n \u2022 Operational requirements of the officer\u2019s division and neighbouring divisions;\n\n \u2022 Obligations of neighbouring divisions to provide coverage to the officer\u2019s division.\n\n81.7 On-Call\n\n On-call is defined as a police officer being available for recall to duty where an urgent or\n immediate policing response is required or where a telephone response is required to manage an\n incident/situation without the need to leave the officer\u2019s place of residence.\n\n81.8 PDOs\n\n (a) At all one and two officer stations, police officers have the option of either taking PDOs\n each 28-day roster or accruing their PDOs up to a maximum of 5 at any time.\n\n 59\n\n (b) Provided that where an officer in a one or two officer station elects to accrue PDOs then\n they may access those PDOs (up to the relevant maximum) separately or in a group.\n However, where the officer applies to take annual leave, the officer must first access any\n accrued PDOs.\n\n81.9 Fatigue\n\n Police officers and managers should always apply the Health and Safety and Fatigue Management\n principles outlined in clause 80 of this Agreement. This is particularly the case:\n\n \u2022 where officers have worked for extended periods;\n\n \u2022 where two officer stations have been reduced to one officer;\n\n \u2022 where officers are covering neighbouring divisions; and\n\n \u2022 at one officer stations generally.\n\n Management will always endeavour to provide cover for any officer on a 10-hour fatigue break.\n\n81.10 Higher Duties\n\n It is recognised that operationally at two officer stations where the OIC is absent on leave, another\n officer should be appointed as the acting OIC. If this officer satisfies the criteria in clause 79\n (Higher Duties), the officer will be paid the appropriate higher duties.\n\n81.11 Miscellaneous\n\n (a) Upon appointment to one and two officer stations police officers are required to reside in\n Service accommodation of a reasonable and suitable standard where such is provided.\n\n If not provided with a residence, the second officer from a two-officer station must reside\n such that they are readily accessible to members of the public outside ordinary hours, can\n respond to call outs, and fulfil the expectations and requirements of the position.\n\n81.12 Relieving Arrangements\n\n (a) i. Police officers relieving or performing temporary duty at one and two officer stations\n will receive the allowance provided that they are readily accessible to members of the\n public outside ordinary hours, can respond to callouts, and fulfil the expectations and\n requirements of the position.\n\n ii. Officers relieving or performing temporary duty at one and two officer stations who\n are in receipt of the allowance will not be entitled to any other allowances that may\n be paid in lieu of any of the items detailed in subclause 42.2 of this Agreement.\n\n iii. This means that an officer who leaves an OSA roster to relieve at a one or two officer\n station does not have an entitlement to OSA from the date they take up duty at such\n station. The allowance prescribed at subclause 42.1 will be payable from this same\n date.\n\n (b) Officer relieving in an OSA position (and eligible to receive OSA) and remaining in a police\n residence:\n\n 60\n\n i. The allowance prescribed at subclause 42.1 ceases immediately and the officer\n receives the OSA and all other provisions normally relating to an OSA position would\n apply.\n\n ii. If called upon by the public at the residence outside of hours (and no other\n arrangements have been put in place by management to cover the situation), then\n overtime provisions apply for the time work is performed.\n\n iii. Recall provisions would only apply where the recall is approved by management.\n\n iv. These arrangements would continue to apply until the officer resumes duties at the\n one or two officer station.\n\n(c) Officer relieving in an OSA position for 28 days or less (and is ineligible to receive OSA)\n and remaining in a police residence:\n\n i. Retain the allowance prescribed at subclause 42.1 at the substantive rate;\n\n ii. None of the entitlements outlined in subclause 42.2 would be paid to the officer\n (irrespective of the work to be performed) unless there are exceptional circumstances\n justifying a particular payment that would be dealt with on a case-by-case basis.\n\n(d) Officer relieving in an OSA position (and eligible to receive OSA) and NOT remaining in\n a police residence:\n\n i. The allowance prescribed at subclause 42.1 ceases immediately and the officer\n receives the OSA and all other provisions normally relating to an OSA position would\n apply.\n\n ii. These arrangements would continue to apply until the officer resumes duties at the\n one or two officer station.\n\n(e) Officer relieving in an OSA position for 28 days or less (and is ineligible to receive OSA)\n and NOT remaining in a police residence:\n\n i. Retain the allowance prescribed at subclause 42.1 at the substantive rate;\n\n ii. None of the entitlements outlined in subclause 42.2 would be paid to the officer.\n\n(f) Officer relieving in a non-OSA position and remaining in a police residence:\n\n i. Retain the allowance prescribed at subclause 42.1 at the substantive rate for a period\n of 28 days.\n\n ii. During the 28-day period, none of the entitlements outlined in subclause 42.2 would\n be paid to the officer (irrespective of the work to be performed) unless there are\n exceptional circumstances justifying a particular payment that would be dealt with on\n a case-by-case basis.\n\n iii. After the 28-day period:\n\n (I) The allowance prescribed at subclause 42.1 would cease and normal provisions\n relating to a non-OSA position would apply until the officer resumes duties at\n the one or two officer station; and\n\n 61\n\n (II) If called upon by the public at the residence outside of hours (and no other\n arrangements have been put in place by management to cover the situation),\n then overtime provisions apply for the time work is performed.\n\n (g) Officer relieving in a non-OSA position and NOT remaining in a police residence:\n\n i. Retain the allowance prescribed at subclause 42.1 at the substantive rate for a period\n of 28 days.\n\n ii. During the 28-day period, none of the entitlements outlined in subclause 42.2 would\n be paid to the officer.\n\n iii. After the 28-day period, the allowance prescribed at subclause 42.1 would cease and\n normal provisions relating to a non-OSA position would apply until the officer\n resumes duties at the one or two officer station.\n\n82 QPCYWAs\n\n 82.1 Weekend Work and Public Holidays\n\n Conditions relating to weekend work and public holidays as prescribed at clauses 25.7(a)(ii),\n 25.7(a)(iii), 25.7(a)(iv), 25.7(d), 25(7)(i) to (m), 36 and 39 of this Agreement apply.\n\n 82.2 Overtime and Travel\n\n The Service may approve payment at normal overtime rates of any overtime performed by a police\n officer at a QPCYWA, which does not relate to their normal duties. Such duties for example may\n include the following:\n\n \u2022 where Road Policing and Regional Support Command provides additional funding to\n perform duties associated with road safety;\n\n \u2022 where Crime and Intelligence Command provides additional funding to perform duties\n associated with policing the prevalence of drugs in local communities;\n\n \u2022 where an officer provides a response to a declared disaster.\n\n 82.3 One Weekend in Four Free of Calls\n\n Officers will be entitled to have a minimum of one weekend or any two consecutive days in each\n 28-day period free of all calls.\n\n 82.4 On-Call\n\n On-call is defined as a police officer being available for recall to duty where an urgent or\n immediate policing response is required or where a telephone response is required to manage an\n incident/situation without the need to leave the officer\u2019s place of residence.\n\n 82.5 PDOs\n\n (a) At all QPCYWAs, officers have the option of either taking PDOs each 28-day roster or\n accruing their PDOs up to a maximum of 5 at any time.\n\n 62\n\n (b) Provided that where an officer at a QPCYWA elects to accrue PDOs then they may access\n those PDOs (up to the relevant maximum) separately or in a group. However, where such\n officer applies to take annual leave, they must first access any accrued PDOs.\n\n82.6 Relieving Arrangements\n\n (a) i. Officers relieving or performing temporary duty at QPCYWAs will receive the\n allowance provided that they can respond to callouts and fulfil the expectations and\n requirements of the position.\n\n ii. Officers relieving or performing temporary duty at QPCYWAs who are in receipt of\n the allowance will not be entitled to any other allowances that may be paid in lieu of\n any of the items detailed in subclause 48.2 of this Agreement.\n\n iii. This means that a police officer who leaves an OSA roster to relieve at a QPCYWA\n does not have an entitlement to OSA from the date they take up duty. The allowance\n prescribed at subclause 48.1 will be payable from this same date.\n\n (b) Officer relieving in an OSA position (and eligible to receive OSA):\n\n i. The allowance prescribed at subclause 48.1 ceases immediately and the officer\n receives the OSA and all other provisions normally relating to an OSA position would\n apply.\n\n ii. These arrangements would continue to apply until the officer resumes duties at the\n QPCYWA.\n\n (c) Officer relieving in an OSA position for 28 days or less (and is ineligible to receive OSA):\n\n i.

The officer be paid their Sergeant salary rate and the allowance prescribed at\n subclause 48.1 or relevant Senior Sergeant salary rate and the allowance prescribed at\n subclause 45.1, whichever is higher;\n\n ii. During the period of relieving, payment of the rate outlined at (i) above compensates\n the officer for all work performed on shift work; overtime (including recalls); and on\n call. The officer remains entitled to ordinary time public holiday penalties and\n ordinary time weekend penalties.\n\n 63\n\n83 Flexible Working Arrangements \u2013 Police Officers\n\n 83.1 The following clauses are to be read in conjunction with clause 8.2 of the Award and the\n Queensland Police Service Policy: Flexible Working Arrangements.\n\n 83.2 Without limiting section 27 of the Industrial Relations Act 2016, a police officer (employed full\n time) should have at least 12 months' satisfactory employment before applying for a Flexible\n Working Arrangement.\n\n 83.3 Flexible Working Arrangements include but are not limited to:\n\n (a) Flexible Hours (part-time) Agreement (FHA)\n (b) Individual Extended shift agreement\n (c) Working remotely\n (d) Compressed hours (non-sworn)\n (e) Any other arrangement outside the normal roster or hours of a work unit\n\n 83.4 Flexible Working Arrangements may commence and/or conclude work on the hour, quarter\n hour, half hour or three-quarter hour.\n\n 83.5 (a) A police officer entering into an FHA will initially engage in a negotiation to determine\n the appropriate operational load of their substantive workplace roster and their capacity\n to perform shift work (if applicable). If a police officer in an OSA position is able to work\n equitably on a pro-rata basis they are entitled to pro-rata OSA as prescribed at subclauses\n 43.1 and 25.7(h)(ii).\n\n (b) Where a police officer is genuinely unable to participate in a shift roster for valid reasons,\n negotiations will continue in an effort to determine a suitable workplace arrangement,\n either within the existing roster or a mutually agreed alternative roster in a suitable\n location.\n\n 83.6 The following will apply in lieu of clause 8.2(o) of the Award:\n\n (a) Any dispute relating to the negotiation of a Flexible Working Arrangement, a direction to\n work additional hours or any other matter relating to the flexible work is to be referred to\n the QPS Flexible Work Committee containing representatives of the Service and the\n relevant unions.\n\n (b) Where the decision from the Flexible Work Committee on any dispute is not accepted by\n a party, that party may refer the matter to the Queensland Industrial Relations Commission.\n Any such dispute will not be subject to the procedures prescribed at clauses 7.1 and 7.2 of\n the Award.\n\n 83.7 Flexible Working Arrangements do not affect a police officer\u2019s eligibility to move within\n classification levels in accordance with the provisions of clause 12.6 of the Award.\n\n 83.8 A police officer with a Flexible Working Arrangement must not be excluded from being\n considered to temporarily fill the office of either a part-time or full-time officer of equal or\n higher rank/level, as a professional development opportunity.\n\n 83.9 Flexible Working Arrangements are not affected by intermittent periods of relieving in another\n position in a full-time or part-time capacity.\n\n 64\n\n 83.10 Where additional ordinary hours are performed by a part-time/flexible hours officer they can\n only utilise sick leave or carer\u2019s leave from additional ordinary hours when at least 50% of the\n additional hours on any day are actually performed.\n\n 83.11 Flexible Working Arrangements may be for a fixed period or ongoing, subject to negotiation.\n\n84 Overpayments\n\n 84.1 The Service will, in consultation with the shared service provider (SSP), establish a process to:\n\n (a) advise individual officers of any overpayments. (In certain circumstances, such as a\n significant overpayment, the SSP may provide formal notification of the debt to the\n officer); and\n\n (b) enable an individual officer to advise the Service of any overpayments the officer may be\n receiving and/or any change in the officer 's circumstances that may affect their pay (e.g.\n changed locality, going on/off shift work etc.)\n\n 84.2 Where an overpayment has occurred, the SSP will notify the officer in accordance with\n subclause 84.1(a) above, that includes the following information:\n\n (a) the amount of the overpayment;\n\n (b) the circumstances as to how the overpayment occurred;\n\n (c) that the SSP will recover the overpayment in accordance with the repayment terms\n outlined in subclause 84.3 below beginning in a fortnightly pay period that gives the\n officer at least 2 weeks to submit a case for financial hardship in accordance with clause\n 84.5 below.\n\n 84.3 (a) Except where subclause 84.4 below applies or where section 376 of the Industrial\n Relations Act 2016 applies, repayments will be made at a rate agreed to in writing\n (includes e-mail) between the officer and the Service. Agreement will not be\n unreasonably withheld.\n\n (b) The parties acknowledge that it is the Service policy to request repayments be made by\n deductions from the officer 's fortnightly pay at the rate of 10% of the net overpayment\n or $200.00, whichever is the greater; OR the full amount of the outstanding overpayment\n if it is less than $200.00.\n\n (c) Repayments cannot be deducted from any fortnightly pay period until after agreement is\n reached between the officer and the Service.\n\n (d) A police officer may elect to make greater repayments than those indicated above.\n\n 84.4 The balance of all overpayments is to be deducted from any termination payment made to a\n police officer.\n 84.5 If a police officer believes that repayments in accordance with Service policy would cause\n financial hardship, then the officer may apply in writing (includes e-mail) to the Executive\n Director, Human Resources Division seeking a lower rate of repayment. No repayments will\n occur until the appropriate Delegate has considered the application, taking into account:\n\n (a) the amount of the overpayment;\n (b) the period of time as to when an overpayment has occurred;\n (c) the financial hardship on the officer.\n\n 65\n\n 84.6 If a police officer is aggrieved by a decision made pursuant to subclause 84.5, then the dispute\n settlement procedures clause 94 of this Agreement applies.\n\n85 Residential Beats\n\n 85.1 General\n\n (a) Residential beat officers will be entitled to an allowance of 18% of each officer's own\n pay point in lieu of overtime (including recalls), on-call allowance, and the shift penalties\n as prescribed by clause 15.5(d) of the Award.

After the 28-day period, payment of the OSA would cease and the officer would be\n entitled to weekend, shift and public holiday penalties as well as overtime and recall,\n as applicable;\n\n iv. There is no entitlement to the Beats allowance as the officer is not residing in the\n residential beat residence and therefore is not required to assist members of the\n public after hours.\n\n 66\n\n(c) Operational shift officer relieving in a beat and also performing duty at the usual station\n during the relieving period (equitably participating in an operational shift roster) and\n NOT residing in a residential beat residence:\n\n Retain the OSA.\n\n(d) A police officer in a one or two officer station or youth club relieving in a beat and\n residing in a residential beat residence:\n\n The allowance prescribed at subclause 42.1 or subclause 48.1 ceases immediately and the\n officer receives the Beats Allowance from the commencement of relieving period.\n\n(e) Officer not in receipt of the OSA or the allowance prescribed at subclause 42.1 or\n subclause 48.1 relieving in a beat and residing in a residential beat residence:\n\n Payment of the Beats allowance would commence immediately.\n\n(f) Residential Beat Officer relieving in an OSA position (and eligible to receive OSA) and\n remaining in a residential beat residence:\n\n i. Beats allowance ceases immediately and the officer receives the OSA and all other\n provisions normally relating to an OSA position would apply;\n\n ii.

Recall provisions would apply only where the recall is approved by management;\n\n iv. These arrangements would continue to apply until officer resumes duties at the\n Police Beat.\n\n(g) Residential Beat Officer relieving in an OSA position (and eligible to receive OSA) and\n NOT remaining in a residential beat residence:\n\n i.

If the officer is required to work a shift that would otherwise qualify for the 15%\n shift allowance (afternoon/night on a weekday), then the shift allowance would be\n paid in addition to the Beats Allowance.\n\n86 Travelling Time \u2013 Non-Commissioned Officers\n\n 86.1 (a) Where non-commissioned officers are required to undertake travel for official purposes,\n such travel should occur where possible within normal rostered hours. Due to the unique\n nature of policing, where an officer is required to travel during an officer's own time then\n the payment for such travel will be paid at the ordinary time rate payable for ordinary hours\n on that day.\n\n (b) As a general rule, in making arrangements for travel, both those organising the travel and\n those who undertake the travelling should be aware of their respective obligations with\n respect to health and safety. Both should be satisfied that access to sufficient rest is\n available between work periods and in determining this aspect, the type and length of duty\n to be worked either immediately before or after the travelling time together with the\n distances and conditions of travel to be undertaken are to be given due consideration.\n\n (c) These provisions do not apply to travelling occurring pursuant to:\n\n i. the provisions of clause 18.7 of the Award;\n\n ii. clause 19 of the Award;\n\n 68\n\n iii. any travelling on transfers - clause 26 of the Award (Transfers \u2013 police officers)\n continues to apply. However, if the Service requires an officer to travel in their own\n time on transfer, then these travelling time provisions apply;\n\n iv. time spent travelling to and from an officer's residence and usual station, section or\n establishment;\n\n v. where an officer is performing relieving/temporary duty away from the usual station,\n section or establishment and alternative accommodation is reasonably required, travel\n between the accommodation and station etc unless exceptional circumstances apply;\n\n vi. any period when the movement on travelling has reasonably ceased e.g. obtaining\n accommodation for the night, arrival at destination; or where proper sleeping facilities\n exist on the transport and are provided to the officer e.g. berth on a ship or train;\n\n vii. travelling outside of Australia.\n\n86.2 General\n\n (a) Subject to subclauses (c) and (d) below, travelling time will mean a period spent in the\n movement of a police officer outside of normal rostered hours from one location to another\n at the requirement of the Service where the primary objective of the journey is the\n movement of that officer to the latter location and the officer is not performing a duty en-\n route.\n\n (b) The term \"duty\" in this clause refers to a task that can only legally be performed by a police\n officer. The carrying of accoutrements of office (including weapons) by a police officer\n does not constitute a \"duty\" for the purposes of these provisions.\n\n (c) Where travelling occurs outside of, and continuously following a normal rostered shift,\n which is required by the Service to complete a duty that commenced or arose during that\n rostered shift, then overtime is payable for the travelling required to complete the task.\n\n (d) If a police officer is directed to perform duty (which includes those instances outlined in\n subclause (f) below) away from their usual station, section or establishment and the total\n travelling time each way is more than 30 minutes in addition to the time (excluding\n exceptional and unexpected delays) the officer would normally travel to and from their\n residence and usual station etc, then travelling time is compensated for that excess\n travelling time. That is, excess travelling time means the travelling time in excess of the\n officer 's normal travel each way to and from work.\n\n (e) Travelling time includes time reasonably spent waiting for the departure of transport e.g.\n trains, aircraft.\n\n (f) Examples of travelling time may include but are not limited to travelling to and from\n courses, conferences, court, special events, operations, meetings or panels.\n\n86.3 Compensation for travelling time\n\n (a) Travelling time will be compensated by payment at the ordinary time rate payable for\n ordinary hours on that day (e.g. double time for a Sunday, etc), calculated on the basis of\n the period of time to the nearest quarter of an hour that was reasonably taken by the most\n practicable direct route using approved means of transport. Payments for travel time do not\n form part of a police officer 's base salary and are not to be included for the purposes of\n paying any allowance or penalty pursuant to an industrial instrument.\n\n 69\n\n (b) Travelling time is not compensated during rostered shifts or overtime.\n\n (c) Compensation for travelling time does not affect a police officer\u2019s entitlement to other\n travelling allowances or expenses that would otherwise apply pursuant to the relevant\n industrial instrument.\n\n87 Leave without Salary Credited as Service\n\n Conditions for crediting of leave without salary as service will be in accordance with the ministerial\n directive relating to Leave without Salary Credited as Service issued by the Minister responsible for\n industrial relations pursuant to the Public Sector Act 2022, as amended or replaced from time to time.\n\n88 Plain Clothes Duty\n\n 88.1 Where a police officer is directed to perform duty in plain clothes and that duty does not attract\n the clothing allowances as prescribed at clause 13.3 of the Award or clauses 31 or 32 of this\n Agreement, the officer will upon application, be reimbursed for any damage to their clothing\n during the performance of that duty. The amount of such reimbursement will be what is\n reasonable and appropriate in the circumstances.\n\n 88.2 Should a Court then award the officer with compensation for clothing damage in the prosecution\n of an offender, the officer will then reimburse the Service the amount paid by the Service, or the\n amount awarded by the Court, whichever is the lesser.\n\n89 Appointment of New Police Officers with Previous Experience\n\n The arrangements for relevant commencement rank and pay point for new appointees as police officers\n are contained in relevant Service policy.\n\n90 Rural and Remote Staffing Strategies\n\n 90.1 Police officers who volunteer to undertake six-month rotations to rural and remote centres as part\n of the Rural and Remote Staffing Strategy are not entitled to Domestic Travel and Relieving\n Expenses as prescribed at clause 76 of this Agreement. In lieu of these entitlements, officers will\n have access to Transfer Expenses as prescribed at clause 73 of this Agreement excluding any\n payments for accommodation expenses at the new centre where suitable accommodation is\n provided by the Service; storage of personal effects; expenses associated with the sale and\n purchase of home or land; dislocation allowance; and education assistance.\n\n Officers who are subsequently transferred (gazetted) to the new centre upon completion of the\n rotation period and are subject to tenure at the rotation centre will be entitled to claim any\n remaining transfer expenses (as applicable) not previously claimable in relation to the initial\n rotation placement.\n\n An officer gazetted to an isolated location is able to apply for lateral transfer after completing\n tenure in accordance with subclause 71.4 of this Agreement.\n\n 90.2 Vacancies advertised (including OIC) at both one and two officer stations may become recurrent\n vacancies for the life of the order of merit or 6 months whichever occurs earliest. Such officers\n on the order of merit may be considered for relevant vacancies that arise during the life of the\n recurrent vacancy pool.\n\n 90.3 Non-commissioned officers transferred at their existing rank to designated rural or remote\n locations may, at time of initial relocation, nominate a district of choice to which they can laterally\n transfer to after completion of their tenure period at the designated rural or remote location. The\n list of designated locations is to be managed through the Transfer Advisory Committee and\n\n 70\n\n subject to approval of the Executive Director Human Resources. This provision only applies to\n those officers gazetted to the rural or remote location on or after the date the initial list of\n designated locations are agreed by the parties. Any officer making use of this provision for\n service at a designated rural or remote location which is subsequently removed from the list of\n designated locations, will maintain their District of choice at completion of tenure.\n\n 90.4 Non-commissioned officers who complete their first period (or new period) of tenure at\n designated hard to fill locations and agree in writing to remain at that location for a further two-\n year period, will if applicable be accelerated one pay point at completion of 12 months service in\n the additional period, and a further pay point at completion of 24 months. Such accelerated pay\n point progression is in addition to normal pay point progression prescribed at clause 13 of this\n Agreement. The designated hard to fill locations will be determined by the parties.\n\n A maximum of 8 weeks paid or unpaid leave per annum will count towards the additional two-\n year period. Any excess leave periods will extend the two-year period accordingly.\n\n A police officer who receives accelerated pay point/s and subsequently transfers from the\n designated location prior to the expiration of the two-year period will lose those accelerated pay\n point/s from the date of departure.\n\n 90.5 Human Resources Division will manage the lists of designated rural and remote, and \u201chard to fill\u201d\n locations as provided for at subclauses 90.3 and 90.4.\n\nPART EIGHT\u2013 REVIEWS\n\n91 Operational Shift Allowance Review\n\n The Service will undertake a review of the application of the OSA during the life of this Agreement,\n specifically in relation to the operational and financial viability of individual rosters. The Service\n undertakes to include QPUE representatives in the review process, and to provide timely advice of any\n proposed changes.\n\n92 Officer in Charge Review\n\n The Service will undertake a review during the life of this Agreement, specifically in relation to OIC\n categories and responsibilities including operational benefits and viability. As part of this review,\n Schedule 3 and subclauses 12.5 and 40 will be considered. The Service undertakes to include QPUE\n representatives in the review process, and to provide timely advice of any proposed changes.\n\n The review will include but is not limited to the following:\n - inequity of Category designations;\n - inequity of recompense for designated duties and responsibilities;\n - appropriateness of existing \u201cstaff\u201d designations;\n - officers not designated as OIC\u2019s are required to perform OIC duties.\n\n93 One and Two Officer Station Review\n\n The Service will undertake a review of the application of the One and Two Officer Station allowance\n and provisions during the life of this Agreement, specifically in relation to the operational and financial\n viability of the allowance. As part of this review, subclauses 42 and 81 will be considered. The Service\n undertakes to include QPUE representatives in the review process, and to provide timely advice of any\n proposed changes.\n\n 71\n\n The review will include but is not limited to the following:\n - review of workload, shift arrangements and overtime (It is recognised that the workloads at some\n One and Two Officer Stations has increased significantly, particularly at those stations in close\n proximity to large population centres.)\n - the parties commit to developing appropriate arrangements and if required appropriate clauses for\n inclusion in the next QPS Certified Agreement to address identified inequity and fatigue\n management issues.\n - no current officer in receipt of this allowance will be financially disadvantaged during the life of\n this agreement.\n\nPART NINE\u2013 PREVENTION AND SETTLEMENT OF DISPUTES\n\n 94 94.1 In the event of any disagreement between the Service and any officer as to the interpretation or\n implementation of this Agreement, the following dispute prevention and settlement procedures\n will be followed.\n\n (a) The matter is to be discussed between the officer concerned or the officer 's representative\n and the immediate supervisor in the first instance.\n\n (b) If the matter is not resolved, it will be referred by the employee or the officer 's\n representative to the appropriate management representative who will, within 24 hours or\n as otherwise agreed, arrange a conference to discuss the matter.\n\n (c) If the matter remains unresolved, it may be referred by the officer or officer 's representative\n to the Commissioner of the Police Service or their nominee, for discussion and appropriate\n action.\n\n (d) If the matter remains unresolved, it may then be referred by either the officer or the officer\n 's representative to the Queensland Industrial Relations Commission for conciliation of the\n matter.\n\n (e) In accordance with the Industrial Relations Act 2016, the Queensland Industrial Relations\n Commission is empowered to settle the matters in dispute.\n\n 94.2 At any step in the abovementioned dispute prevention and settlement procedure a police officer\n is entitled to be represented by an appropriate industrial organisation of employees.\n\n 94.3 Whilst the dispute prevention and settlement procedure is being followed:\n\n (a) Subject to the provisions of the PSAA, normal work is to continue except in the case of a\n genuine safety issue, provided that a police officer will continue to work normal work\n where there exist circumstances envisaged by the provisions of clause 15.2(e) and (f) of the\n Award.\n\n (b) The status quo existing before the emergence of a dispute is to continue and neither the\n Service nor the officer is to be prejudiced as to the final settlement of the matter by the\n continuation of the status quo.\n\n 94.4 In the pursuance of the dispute prevention and settlement procedure all relevant information will\n be provided.\n\n 94.5 For clause 94.1(a) of this Agreement and Part 2 \u2013 Dispute Resolution - of the Award, immediate\n supervisor may be read as decision maker.\n\n 72\n\n95 To remove any doubt, the provisions at clause 11, Consultation \u2013 Introduction of changes- all\n employees, of the Award continue to apply as required by section 198(1)(a) Industrial Relation Act\n 2016.\n\n

RLI payments are also payable to those police officers undertaking\n temporary service/relieving at designated locations in accordance with Section 5.2 below.\n\n2.2 RLI payments are not included in the assessment or calculation of other entitlements, such as leave\n loading, overtime or shift/weekend penalties.\n\n2.3 Designated locations are outlined as follows:\n\n Northern Region / Far Southern Region Central Region Brisbane\n North\n Northern Region Region Coast\n Region\n Coen Laura Adavale Hungerford Alpha Jundah Dunwich** Fraser\n Island\n (K\u2019Gari)**\n Croyden Mt Surprise Russell\n Augathella Morven Aramac Longreach\n Island**\n Thursday Macleay\n Forsayth Bollon Mungallala Barcaldine Muttaburra\n Island Island**\n\n 96\n\n Georgetown Prairie Charleville Murgon Blackall Tambo\n Greenvale Richmond Cunnamulla Quilpie Ilfracombe Windorah\n Horn Island Weipa Eromanga Thargomindah Isisford Winton\n Hughenden Eulo Wyandra Jericho Yaraka\n All locations in Mt Isa\n District where the Area\n Allowance* does not\n apply.\n\n* Area Allowance as provided for at Clause 27 of this Agreement.\n** Entitlement is 50% of the RLI payment\n\nPART 3 \u2013 AMOUNT\n\nThe annual payment amounts for the RLI are indicated as follows:\n\nAnnual Payment Amounts\n Year Amount\n 1st year $ 4,000\n 2nd year $ 5,000\n 3rd and subsequent years $ 7,000\n\nProgression from one amount to another is on a calendar basis and is not disrupted by an absence due to work\nrequirements, relieving or paid leave.\n\nRLI payments are subject to PAYG tax.\n\nPART 4 \u2013 ELIGIBILITY\n\n4.1 Part Time\n\n Part-time officers appointed to a designated location are eligible for a pro-rata rate of the amounts\n prescribed at Part 3.\n\n4.2 Termination of Entitlement\n\n A police officer\u2019s eligibility for RLI payments ceases upon employment separation or a permanent\n transfer/appointment to a non-designated location.\n\nPART 5 \u2013 PAYMENT\n\nAnnual RLI payments will be made in arrears in accordance with the amounts prescribed at Part 3.\n\n5.1 Permanent Service\n\n RLI payments for permanent service will be made annually in January in respect of whole months of\n continuous recognised service in a designated location during the twelve months preceding 1 January.\n Each instance of continuous permanent service in a designated location will be treated separately for the\n purpose of RLI payments.\n\n Upon a payment in January based on the \u2018Year 1\u2019 amount, a police officer will be deemed to have\n completed \u2018Year 1\u2019 and to have commenced \u2018Year 2\u2019 on 1 January. Similarly, on a payment in January\n\n 97\n\n based on the \u2018Year 2\u2019 amount, a police officer will be deemed to have completed \u2018Year 2\u2019 and to have\n commenced \u2018Year 3\u2019 on 1 January. This \u2018deeming\u2019 arrangement applies only for the purpose of RLI\n payments.\n\n Where a police officer\u2019s eligibility for RLI payments ceases because of employment separation or a\n permanent transfer/appointment to a non-designated location, a pro-rata payment, based on completed\n whole months of recognised service since the previous 1 January, will be made at the time of eligibility\n ceasing.\n\n A police officer who takes up permanent service at a designated location after serving at a non-\n designated location, having previously received an RLI payment, will be eligible for that same level of\n payment.\n\n5.2 Temporary Service\n\n RLI payments for completed whole months of temporary service will be made at the time of ceasing the\n temporary service. Payments will be based on the \u2018Year 1\u2019 amount only. Each instance of continuous\n temporary service will be treated separately for the purpose of RLI payments.\n\n5.3 Paid Leave\n\n Eligibility for RLI payments is not disrupted when a police officer takes paid leave. Leave on half-pay\n will attract a pro-rata rate of RLI payments.\n\n5.4 Leave without Pay\n\n Any leave without pay will not attract RLI payments.\n\n5.5 Relieving in Non-Designated Locations\n\n Eligibility for RLI payments is suspended after 42 calendar days when relieving or otherwise working\n in a non-designated location in a temporary capacity.\n\n5.6 Area Allowance\n\n A police officer is not entitled to receive RLI payments when in receipt of an Area Allowance.\n\n Previous service at an Area Allowance centre will be recognised in determining the level of RLI payment\n following appointment to a designated location.\n\n A police officer stationed at a centre where Area Allowance is payable in accordance with this\n Agreement but residing at a designated location outlined in Part 3 above, will be entitled to the RLI\n payment in accordance with this Schedule. Area Allowance is not payable in these circumstances where\n the police officer is not living in the community attracting Area Allowance.\n\n For periods where sufficient QPS/Government housing or rental housing on the open market within the\n community is not available, and as a consequence a police officer appointed to an Area Allowance\n location after applying for housing within the community, has to reside outside the community at a\n location where both Area Allowance and RLI payments do not apply, then RLI payments will apply.\n Where housing does become available to such police officer in the Area Allowance community, that\n such officer receiving RLIP as per above, is offered appropriate housing in the community, and such\n offer is not accepted, then RLI payment immediately ceases.\n\n 98\n\nSCHEDULE 6\n\n CPI UPLIFT ADJUSTMENT (CUA) AND WAGES CLAUSE\n\nWage Increases\n\n (1) This Agreement provides for the following wage increases:\n a.
